Just as print has evolved from simple movable type, gaining fidelity and power along the way, over the past thirty years the web has evolved from black text and blue hyperlinks to rich experiences and media delivered over broadband. But today, as most of our media consumption shifts to mobile devices and wireless data, designers are at a strange new crossroads. How can we continue to move the web forward, with more detailed imagery and more ambitious design, while also working within the constraints of small screens and unreliable networks? In this talk we’ll consider the web as a physical medium, constrained by bandwidth and device capabilities. But we’ll also look at the web as an adaptive medium, where our work can consist not only of pixels and words, but also metadata and instructions for displaying content across all kinds of devices.
