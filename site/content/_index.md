Since 2020 I've been a PM for [Google&nbsp;Fonts](https://fonts.google.com). Before that I worked on [Material Design](https://material.io), and before that I led product and was an engineer for [Adobe Typekit](https://fonts.adobe.com/). I've been working on the web since 1995 as a designer, programmer, and strategist.
