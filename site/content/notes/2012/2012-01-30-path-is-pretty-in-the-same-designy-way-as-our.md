  Path is pretty in the same designy way as our modern museums. These museums
  are very exciting when they open. You show up and marvel along with all of the
  other fans of architecture. Maybe you return for one of those nights where
  they stay open late and there is a band and drinking. “A great space,” you
  think. Maybe one day you’ll be rich and rent out the atrium for a private
  party. The art doesn’t get talked about so much at these museums. The museum
  itself is the “social object,” as it were. Eventually the particulars around
  which the museum was designed fall out of fashion. A fresh crop of architects
  finds it to be too flashy, or too dull, or to have been guided by faulty
  principles. There is congestion where there should be flow. Certain rooms are
  simply exhausting. Maybe it is even an eyesore. This is good for the museum.
  Now they can really fuck up the place…


  Path is a monument to Path. It is no place to scribble in. I wish it longevity
  so that it might find shabbiness.

  Spot on. I've enjoyed using Path and I like how fluid the user experience is,
  and this version 2.0 is definitely more versatile than their first one. But
  it's not where my friends are, and it's not going to be. My friends are on
  many platforms, not just iOS. They leave links and comments, not just smileys,
  photos, and check-ins.


  Path is a social network for people so swamped in the tech sector to be bored
  with social networking. Most people don't want or need a simpler Facebook.
