Paul Haddad explains what [Twitter's new guidelines](https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api) (which I discussed a bit [in my last post](http://log.demaree.me/post/29625275925/what-twitters-api-announcement-could-have-said)) mean for the future of Tweetbot. If the title wasn't enough indication, while Haddad doesn't sound _thrilled_, in short they're not worried about it.
