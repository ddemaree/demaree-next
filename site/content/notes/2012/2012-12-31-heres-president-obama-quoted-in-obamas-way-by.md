  Here’s President Obama quoted in [Obama’s
  Way](http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/10/michael-lewis-profile-barack-obama)
  by Michael Lewis:


  > “You’ll see I wear only gray or blue suits,” he said. “I’m trying to pare
  down decisions. I don’t want to make decisions about what I’m eating or
  wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make.”


  As a programmer you make decisions all day (and maybe all night) long. When a
  choice between MVC and anything else comes up, choose MVC. Save yourself from
  decision fatigue — because you want to be at your best for all the hard
  choices.


  When I was a less-experienced programmer I would have disagreed with the
  above. I would have replied that there’s no excuse for not using your brain.


  But over the years I’ve learned that one of the keys to working intelligently
  is recognizing when you’ve encountered a settled matter, and being wise enough
  to avoid wasting any decision energy when those come up.
