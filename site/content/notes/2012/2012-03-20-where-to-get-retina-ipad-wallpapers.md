title: Where to get Retina iPad wallpapers

UI designer [Louie Mantia](http://mantia.me/), whose ["Andy's Room"](http://mantia.me/wallpaper/andys-room/) background I use on literally _all_ of my devices, has started upconverting [his wallpapers](http://mantia.me/) to Retina format. Only a few of them have been done so far, including all of the ones in the slideshow on [his home page](http://mantia.me/), but I think he intends to post new ones regularly until they're all updated.

Also, the Fifty Foot Shadows blog has released [a pack of very nice-looking photographic wallpapers](http://fiftyfootshadows.net/2012/03/19/retina-ipad/).
