  As it turned out, sharing was not broken. Sharing was working fine and dandy,
  Google just wasn’t part of it. People were sharing all around us and seemed
  quite happy. A user exodus from Facebook never materialized. I couldn’t even
  get my own teenage daughter to look at Google+ twice, “social isn’t a
  product,” she told me after I gave her a demo, “social is people and the
  people are on Facebook.” Google was the rich kid who, after having discovered
  he wasn’t invited to the party, built his own party in retaliation. The fact
  that no one came to Google’s party became the elephant in the room.
