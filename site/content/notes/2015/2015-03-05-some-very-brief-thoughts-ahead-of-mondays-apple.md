<p>I'm playing with doing some (all?) of my writing over on Medium, now that <a href="https://medium.com/inside/blogging-on-medium-95f1546bcd7d">Medium is for blogging</a>.</p><p>FWIW, nearly everything Sippey says in the just-linked post about the unit of blogging being the Stream may not have applied to Medium, but it sure does apply to Tumblr. Also, while Tumblr has excellent iOS apps, excellent APIs, and has supported post-by-email since early on, Medium remains bizarrely hostile to authoring and editing on mobile devices. Finally, Tumblr offers one very important feature that's not only not available on Medium, but kinda against the grain of what Medium is: the ability to publish stuff under one's own domain name. A decision to put stuff on Medium means being okay with <i>medium.com/@ddemaree</i> vs <i>log.demaree.me</i>&nbsp;as my masthead.</p><p>Having said that, I like the Medium team, and I'm interested in streams made up of writing and not also cat GIFs. So let's see where this goes.</p><p>(For the lazy, I'll probably set up an IFTTT trigger that automatically posts links to Medium stuff over here.)</p>
