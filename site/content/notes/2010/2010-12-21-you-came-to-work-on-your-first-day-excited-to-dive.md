  Instead, your schedule looked like this:


  > 9:00 AM - 10:30 AM Product Development Committee status update meeting    

  > 11:00 AM - Noon Team Scrum status meeting    

  > 12:30 - 2:00 PM Product demo and architecture meeting    

  > 2:00 PM - 3:30 PM Halo 3 tournament    

  > 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM Skype video chat with Bangalore team
