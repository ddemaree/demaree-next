  It took me some twenty-plus years to really learn how to program. It wasn’t
  for a lack of trying either, it was just that I was trying the wrong way. I
  tried to learn to program by following tutorials that created programs I
  didn’t have the slightest interest in keeping. I was trying to learn for the
  sake of learning.


  What made it click for me was programming in anger. Programming because I
  needed to. Programming because I gave a damn about what I was writing and I
  wanted it done sooner rather than later.
