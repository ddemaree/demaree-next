Derek Sivers on how consideration and civility go completely out the window when strangers talk to each other over the internet:

> Last week, one of her clients sent her a 10-page-long scathing email, chopping her down, calling her a scam artist and a other vicious personal insults, saying she was going to sue her for everything she's worth as retribution for her mis-handled account. [...] The client cheerfully took her call and said, “Oh don't worry about it! I wasn't actually that upset. I was just in a bad mood, and didn't think anyone would read my email anyway.”
