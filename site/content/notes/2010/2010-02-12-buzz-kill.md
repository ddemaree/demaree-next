This could be a thing. She writes:

> I use my private Gmail account to email my boyfriend and my mother. There’s a BIG drop-off between them and my other “most frequent” contacts.
>
> You know who my third most frequent contact is? My abusive ex-husband.
>
> Which is why it’s SO EXCITING, Google, that you AUTOMATICALLY allowed all my most frequent contacts access to my Reader, including all the comments I’ve made on Reader items, usually shared with my boyfriend, who I had NO REASON to hide my current location or workplace from, and never did.

This isn't crazy talk; when I opened Buzz yesterday morning I was shocked to discover my ex-girlfriend was one of my followers. She's not anymore, and it's not like I post anything here or on Twitter that I need to hide from her, but still: awkward.
