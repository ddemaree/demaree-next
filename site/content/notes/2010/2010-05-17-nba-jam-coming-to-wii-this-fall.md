[The only sports video game I ever loved](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Jam) is coming back. The new game is being developed by EA SPORTS (in collaboration with the original game's lead programmer/designer), and came about after EA had started planning a different basketball game that started to feel an awful lot like the old _NBA Jam_ from 1993:

> Six or seven months passed after [their initial concept, "Bounce"] was conceived. The game wasn't greenlit yet, but a meeting happened. And in this EA meeting, Smith "kind of freaked out." Listen, he told everyone: "We're going to be compared to NBA Jam, so we might as well be NBA Jam."

> The original NBA Jam is legendary. It was an arcade and cultural phenomenon when it was released by Midway in 1993. Its over-the-top two-on-two super-charged, flaming-basketball version of one of America's favorite sports was a transcendent hit, popularizing phrases such as "He's on fire!" and "Boomshakalaka."
