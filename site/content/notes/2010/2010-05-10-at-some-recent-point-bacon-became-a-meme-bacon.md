  At some recent point, bacon became a meme. Bacon. The cured pork product that
  has been a staple food for hundreds of years was suddenly a fashion accessory
  for Internet style-mongers. There were odes and T-shirts and cartoons. People
  taped bacon to their cats and took photos. It was so ubiquitous that I started
  to hate bacon.


  No one should ever have to hate bacon.
