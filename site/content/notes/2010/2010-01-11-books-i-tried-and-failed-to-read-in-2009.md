summary: Books I tried, and failed, to read in 2009
title: Books I tried, and failed, to read in 2009
---

* <cite>The Ascent of Money</cite>, Niall Ferguson
* <cite>The Housing Boom and Bust</cite>, Thomas Sowell
* <cite>SuperFreakonomics</cite>, Levitt/Dubner
* <cite>Spent</cite>, Geoffrey Miller
* <cite>Snoop</cite>, Sam Gosling
* <cite>Nixonland</cite>, Rick Perlstein
* <cite>Create Your Own Economy</cite>, Tyler Cowen
* <cite>Infinite Jest</cite>, David Foster Wallace

Several of the books are about economics, or a subject related to economics. It's a very difficult field to write about in an engaging way. A couple of the books do an okay job of it, but their specific topics are so thin (like Miller's thesis about the connection between mating and consumer behaviors) that after a chapter or two the author seems to just be filling space.

Authors should not try to emulate Malcolm Gladwell as much as they do. We already have one Gladwell, and sometimes even he isn't that great at being Gladwellian.

The historical books (Ferguson and Perlstein) weren't finished for different reasons. I _almost_ made it to the end of <cite>Ascent</cite>, but stalled when Ferguson started trying to explain the current financial crisis, and connect it to his previous bits about the emergence of debt and moneylending in the Italian Renaissance. (Or, conversely, when he tries to explain a bit of banking history by comparing it to something from the current, inscrutable banking system.)

<cite>Nixonland</cite> is a great book, but very long, and the author's voice pops into it a bit too often for my taste. I didn't need to be reminded every other chapter that some something or other was, in fact, "Nixonland."

Sowell I should have known better than to read&mdash;the author's a right-wing economist writing about a debt/mortgage crisis that, in his view, could easily be attributed to poor people and liberal policies aimed at helping poor people.

Everything people have said about <cite>SuperFreakonomics</cite> being tragically wrongheaded about (e.g.) global warming is true. And it's not a good enough book for me to overlook such woefully flawed logic, especially knowing (from the last book and their blog) what smart guys Levitt & Dubner are.

<cite>Infinite Jest</cite> is torture. I read a third to a half of it last summer, and remember it being two or three brilliant chapters interspersed with stuff that is, to varying degrees, rubbish. It's a book that demands too much of you.

Which books _did_ I finish?
