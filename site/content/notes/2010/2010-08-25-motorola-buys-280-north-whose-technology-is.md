280 North's products are:

* 280 Slides, a web-based clone of Apple's Keynote slideshow app
* Atlas, a web-based clone of Apple's Interface Builder tool
* Objective-J, a port of Apple's Objective-C language to JavaScript
* And Cappuccino, a JavaScript framework deeply indebted to Apple's Cocoa frameworks

This is a really weird acquisition. Not only are 280 North all about Apple, but their products are all about mimicking _desktop_ user experiences in _desktop_ web browsers. Sure, they're smart guys who surely can bring a lot of Web knowledge to a company that desperately needs it, but nothing on 280's résumé says they're worth paying $20 million so they can work on _mobile_ stuff for _Android_.

**Update:** Okay, Fred Polgardy [has set me straight](http://twitter.com/polgfred/status/22090461626): 280 North's Tom Robinson developed [Narwhal](http://narwhaljs.org/), which is definitely _not_ "just Apple stuff ported to JavaScript."
