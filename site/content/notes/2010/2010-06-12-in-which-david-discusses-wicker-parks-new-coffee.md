title: Wicker Park's new coffee shop renaissance
---

In 2007, the beloved Wicker Park coffee shop [Filter](http://chicago.metromix.com/restaurants/baked_goods/filter-bucktown-wicker-park/1140079/content) closed (along with Swank Frank, my then-favorite hot dog joint) after losing their lease, to be replaced by a Bank of America branch.

Filter wasn't the only place to get a cup of coffee in Wicker Park, but it was the only coffee shop where it was comfy and cool to just come _hang out_ for a while. (Rather, it was the _last_ one—others had come during the neighborhood's 1990s heyday and since closed down.) The next best option afterward was Marshall McGearty, a concept smoke shop-as-Starbucks owned and operated by the R.J. Reynolds tobacco company, that was friendlier and more comfy than it had any right to be. Naturally it was smoking-friendly — smoking was, indeed, the whole point — and consequently it shut down early in 2008 after Chicago's restaurant smoking ban took effect.

Consequently, for most of the last two years Chicago's most hipsterrific neighborhood has been without any decent coffee hangouts. But that has now changed!

For starters, Filter is back—after rumored plans to move to the West Loop or Ukrainian Village, they've reopened a couple of blocks down Milwaukee Ave. from their old spot. The new Filter is bigger, brand-new, and conveniently located next to the Copenhagen Cyclery bike boutique. Yet, somehow, it's still absolutely _Filter_. The chairs are thrift-store, the walls are exposed brick, the coffee is good and the fries are sweet potato.

So that's pretty great. But now there are _also_ two new places to coffee up near the six corners:

- [Buzz: Killer Espresso](http://chicago.metromix.com/restaurants/baked_goods/buzz-killer-espresso-bucktown-wicker-park/1687641/content) on Damen, "celebrating artful espresso and small-batch roasters."

- And [The Wormhole](http://chicago.metromix.com/restaurants/baked_goods/the-wormhole-coffee-bucktown-wicker-park/1879039/content), near Filter on Milwaukee, where I'm typing this up, which is another thing entirely.

Some context for The Wormhole: it is Chicago's _second_ 80's-themed coffee shop, after [New Wave Coffee](http://chicago.metromix.com/restaurants/baked_goods/new-wave-coffee-logan-square/1017174/content) in Logan Square. Where NWC is vegan-friendly and focused on neon colors and kitschy music, Wormhole is a different kind of pastiche. There are Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle dolls on the tables and _Star Wars_ stormtrooper mugs on the counter. Next to the front door there is an _actual honest to god I shit you not_ DeLorean from the <cite>Back to the Future</cite> movies. NWC has a late-80s Sony TV with an NES hooked up to it; Wormhole's TV is from the early 80s, and it has an Atari 2600.

But other than that, and more importantly, The Wormhole seems to be based on something completely different: it reminds me _a lot_ of [Ritual Coffee Roasters](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ritual-coffee-roasters-san-francisco) in the Mission in San Francisco.

For a place that's only been here a week, something about Wormhole feels _old_ and _comfortable_ and _lived-in_. I'm not sure exactly how long Ritual Roasters has been on Valencia, but it's a study in how to set up a hip-but-comfy neighborhood coffee shop. The chairs are secondhand, but not too shabby, and seem to reflect a singular, very tasteful design sensibility.

The other place, Buzz, just rubbed me the wrong way. It felt like someone's living room in a _bad_ way—cramped, with poorly chosen seats and not enough of them. The coffee was better than fine (one of the baristas is a guy I used to work with at Starbucks, who I can vouch for as someone who _really_ knows good coffee), but it's expensive and maybe not worth staying around to savor. (Also, they have a 1-hour limit on their free Wi-Fi. Filter has a more generous 2 hours, and Wormhole has no limit at all.)

So, yeah, I'm a bit smitten. I didn't think Chicago made places like this anymore; I'm very glad to have been wrong.
