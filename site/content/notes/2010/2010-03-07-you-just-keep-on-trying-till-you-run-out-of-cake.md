If you hadn't heard, Valve is expected to announce _Portal 2_ this Tuesday at GDC. _GameInformer_'s upcoming cover story on the new game leaked over the weekend, and the helpful folks at the _Portal_ Wiki scanned and transcribed it.

The whole article is worth reading, so I won't summarize it here. But I will point out one interesting detail: the the list of launch platforms on the first page of the article includes the Mac, confirming what you already knew if you've been following [Valve's recent teaser campaign][gz]. Even so, let's take a step back and ponder this: _Portal 2_ is a major game from a big-time developer, and it will have Mac support on day one.

Of course, "Mac support" can mean a lot of things. EA has been selling "Mac-compatible" versions of its games on launch day for years. But they cheat: their Mac versions are in fact just the Windows versions running in an emulator.

But Valve is a company known for making quality products. Emulated Windows games are adequate at best, and I just don't see Valve shipping something that's just adequate.
