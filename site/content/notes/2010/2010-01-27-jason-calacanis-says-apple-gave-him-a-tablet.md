Calacanis says it has an OLED screen, a solar panel for recharging, an HDTV tuner and a DVR built-in. He also says there's a Farmville app for the Tablet, that Steve Jobs himself is going to demo it onstage today, and it's "insane." (Note to future fake rumormongers: Steve Jobs _never_ demos third-party apps, and companies that aren't household brands like EA or the _New York Times_ are _never_ given early access to Apple SDKs.)

When someone's either delusional or lying, you need to ask: _qui bono?_ What do they stand to gain from the lie? If this were true, it doesn't matter how much he loves the device: Apple will never, ever give Jason Calacanis access to them again. And if it's not, we'll all know it in a few hours and he'll look like a liar, if not insane.

**Update:** [Shane Vitarana](http://twitter.com/shanev) answers the question of [why Calacanis would pull a lame stunt like this](http://twitter.com/shanev/statuses/8272252809).
