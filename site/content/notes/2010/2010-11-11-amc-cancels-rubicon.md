Not at all surprising. I enjoyed watching the show while it was on, and it had a few well-written episodes. But neither the characters nor the season-long mystery ever really came together enough for me to be excited for season two. Meanwhile, AMC's new zombie series _The Walking Dead_ (which I'm enjoying way more than I ever expected to) is the highest rated show on cable, which if I were an AMC exec would lead me to think they could do better than a sleepy old spy show.
