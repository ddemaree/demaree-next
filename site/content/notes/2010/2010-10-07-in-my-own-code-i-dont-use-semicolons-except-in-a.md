  In my own code, I don't use semicolons except in a few specific instances, and
  then as a prefix or separator. &hellip; Likewise, I think it's silly to wear
  pants when it's warm.  Everyone knows it's more comfortable not to, and it's
  only a silly social custom that entraps us in these tight pieces of cloth all
  day long. In my own house, I'm often pantsless.  But when visiting a friend's
  house, I put on pants, because that's the custom, and that's how they like
  it.  (Unless they happen to also be ok with being pantsless, and then it's an
  underpants party.) 


  The point is, I don't put semicolons in npm code, but I do put them in
  [node.js](http://nodejs.org) code, because Ryan Dahl wears pants, and node is
  his house.


  In your own house, you get to decide the styles and customs.  But be aware
  that it might have an effect on who feels comfortable at your parties.
