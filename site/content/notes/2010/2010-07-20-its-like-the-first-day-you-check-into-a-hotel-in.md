  It's like the first day you check into a hotel in L.A. there's a message under
  your door. The second day, there's eleven messages under your door. The third
  day, there's thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy messages. And I realized
  that they just want fresh blood. They. Just. Want. Fresh. Blood. You gotta get
  the hell out of there. And you really feel, if you live in New York, that
  you're three hours ahead of themâ€”I mean that literally. It's like, _Oh man, we
  gotta help these people!_ And the longer you stay there, the less ahead of
  them you get, and then you're one of them. No way, man.
