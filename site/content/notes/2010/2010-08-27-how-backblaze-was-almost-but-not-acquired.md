[Backblaze](http://backblaze.com/) is an online backup service; you install some software on your computer, and it'll continually back up your hard drive to their secure servers. They're a small company, but profitable and growing, and unlike a lot of startups they chose not to take VC money so they wouldn't be forced to "exit" as soon as the opportunity came for their investors to get a payday.

That being said, last year they did talk to a couple of (unnamed) companies about an acquisition, and came within days of closing a deal with one of them before it simply collapsed at the last minute.
