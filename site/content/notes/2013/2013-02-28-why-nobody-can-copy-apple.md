Short version: because they design products for only one kind of customer — consumers —whereas Google's attention is split between advertisers and consumers, Samsung's is split between carriers and consumers, and Microsoft's is split between businesses, enterprises, OEMs, integration partners, and some absurd idea of what American teenagers ("consumers") want.

I'd go further and say Apple designs products for _people_, and don't acknowledge those distinctions or treat different kinds of markets or use cases as totally different when designing products.
