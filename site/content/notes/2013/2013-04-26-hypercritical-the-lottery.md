John Siracusa has changed his mind about whether Apple should switch to a lottery system for WWDC tickets; he now thinks they should.

But it's his second point that's the real long-term solution. The reason WWDC sells out in _90 fucking seconds_ is because it's developers' only reliable opportunity to talk to, and get help from, Apple engineers. While there is certainly a method to Apple's total secrecy on new product development, there's no outwardly obvious reason why they're so opaque in how they support developers on their platform. Developer tech support, App Store review, even their process for reporting bugs in their APIsâ€”all black boxes.

Apple don't need radical transparency. What they may need are more developer events, like the regional tech talks they've done every few years. My only firsthand Apple developer experience was at a Chicago tech talks event in 2008, which was like a mini-WWDC. That was also the last event Apple like that in Chicago (or in the Midwest, if memory serves), which is a shame. Apple should do more of those, more regularly.
