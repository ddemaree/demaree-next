Thank you, John Resig, for putting something I've believed for a long while into simple words.

While it is true (and, I'll admit, troublesome) WebKit is disproportionately controlled by Apple and Google, they don't have total control, and having all the major browser vendors (and W3C member companies) collaborating on a single implementation rather than on multiple competing, sort-of-compatible ones is probably better for the long-term health of both the Web and WebKit.
