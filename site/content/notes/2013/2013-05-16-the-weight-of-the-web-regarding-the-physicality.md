Slides from the talk I just finished presenting at TYPO Berlin 2013. I was a ball of jet lag and nerves, but if the live-tweeting from [@mfacomdes](http://twitter.com/mfacomdes/) is at all representative, it would seem that I got across what I wanted to, and that the bits that were interesting and significant to me were to other people as well.

_Vielen dank_ to everyone who watched it, to all my friends/colleagues who helped shape the talk over the last couple weeks, and of course to TYPO for having me.
