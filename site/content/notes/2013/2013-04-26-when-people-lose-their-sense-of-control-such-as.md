  When people lose their sense of control, such as when tasks are dictated to
  them, the brain's emotional response center can actually cause a decrease in
  cognitive functioning. This perception of not being in control, whether real
  or imagined, would presumably lead to a drop in productivity. If a manager
  describes the long-term outcome he wants, rather than dictating specific
  actions, the employee can decide how to arrive there and preserve his
  perceived sense of control, cognitive function, and ultimately improve his
  productivity.
