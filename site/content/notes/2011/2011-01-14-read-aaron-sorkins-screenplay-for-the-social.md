As part of Deadline.com's award season coverage, they interviewed Sorkin about the film and posted [a PDF of the complete screenplay](http://www-deadline-com.vimg.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/TheSocialNetwork.pdf). Reading the amazing opening scene—where Zuckerberg's girlfriend breaks up with him—the most notable thing is how simple and economical Sorkin's writing is. The scene is 8&frac12; pages of almost nothing but dialogue, and almost the only stage direction setting up their conversation is this: "The scene is stark and simple."
