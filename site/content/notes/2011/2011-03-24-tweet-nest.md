A really nice lightweight PHP app for archiving and browsing your Tweets on your own server. Installed it on [my personal site](http://home.demaree.me/tweets) in less than 5 minutes, then lost at least half an hour exploring the stuff I was tweeting about in 2009. 

For example, [here's how I reacted when Jeff Veen announced Typekit](http://twitter.com/ddemaree/status/1947825938), long before I knew not to capitalize the 'K', and long _long_ before I ever imagined I might work for them.
