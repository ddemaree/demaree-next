It's amazing how every time ABA launches a new title about making websites it feels like _an event_, one that smart people worth paying attention to are genuinely excited about. Erin Kissane's _Elements of Content Strategy_ is (naturally) less about code than the HTML5 and CSS3 books preceding it, but no less succinct, clear, practical and great.
