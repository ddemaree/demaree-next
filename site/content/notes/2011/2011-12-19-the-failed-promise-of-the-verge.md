Verge, the new project from the former Engadget editors who left to start their own site after theirs was acquired by AOL, is probably the best shitty gadget rag out there. But it's still a shitty gadget rag, and Ben Brooks wanted more:

> There is just a lot of vanilla tech reporting going on — the kind that I expect to see on CNET. Which is a shame because by all accounts the writers for the site are smart — the type that should get it, but refuse to spell it out for readers.

> In fact the most compelling and interesting writing in The Verge are the posts that its senior editors post in the “forum” in response to criticism. That shouldn’t be the case, yet they are the only posts I look forward to reading on the site.

Given I'm what many internet people would call an "Apple fanboi", and that Gizmodo was making me vomit even _before_ they stooped to theft in pursuit of an exclusive scoop, I can't honestly say I expected much from The Verge. I will grant them this: if you're gonna read a gadget rag, theirs is the best one.

But if you want to read a technology site that aims higher than just cataloguing an endless parade of mediocre crap, sorry, but it doesn't exist. No one is trying to hold technology companies to _any_ kind of standard.

Then again, press outlets generally don't hold anyone accountable for anything these days. Just as there's "a debate" about whether global warming is real when it's 45º in Chicago on December 19, a cell phone that's too big to fit in your pocket, and can't hold a battery charge for more than an hour, is said to have "drawbacks."

Someone should try putting out an Onion-style satirical publication devoted exclusively to the tech industry. It wouldn't be at all hard to find material for it.
