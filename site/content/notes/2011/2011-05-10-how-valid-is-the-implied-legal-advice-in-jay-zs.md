I don't know what's crazier: that someone on Quora asked this question, or that the answers were so detailed and thoughtful:

> > "Well do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?"  
> > Well my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back  
> > And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
>
> Consenting to a voluntary search is never a good idea, especially if you have felony weight on you. The standard to search the glove compartment is actually fairly low in California, since it's accessible to the driver. I'm not sure how the locked status interferes with it being a glove compartment. The trunk can be opened if the car is impounded, for inventory reasons, which is a common way to get evidence. However, a locked case inside the trunk will not be opened (depends on the state).
