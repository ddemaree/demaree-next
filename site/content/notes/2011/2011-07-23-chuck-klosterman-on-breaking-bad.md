Chuck Klosterman writes for _Grantland_ on the four Great American T.V. Shows of the 2000’s — _The Sopranos_, _The Wire_, _Mad Men_ and _Breaking Bad_ — and why, for him, _Breaking Bad_ is the greatest of the four:

> I suspect _Breaking Bad_ will be the least remembered of these four shows and will probably be the least influential over time. Yet there's one profound difference between this series and the other three, and it has to do with its handling of morality: Breaking Bad is the only one built on the uncomfortable premise that there's an irrefutable difference between what's right and what's wrong, and it's the only one where the characters have real control over how they choose to live.
