Yes, children, Amazon is doing for email what they did for [data storage](http://aws.amazon.com/s3). SES provides app developers with a robust, scalable way to send bulk or transactional emails using a simple, RESTful API. Java or .NET clients are provided; I bet $10 the first Ruby library for sending mail through SES is up before close of business today.
