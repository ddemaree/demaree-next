The rumor mill is saying _not_ to expect a new iPhone to be announced at WWDC in June, even though Apple has announced new iPhone models there three years in a row. It's also saying iOS 5 will be announced (not released) at the show, OS X Lion _will_ be released, and we'll also finally learn about Apple's latest attempt to launch a cloud service and demonstrate that they really do get the internet.

Speaking of WWDC â€˜11, tickets went on sale earlier today for $1,599 each. They're reportedly already sold out.
