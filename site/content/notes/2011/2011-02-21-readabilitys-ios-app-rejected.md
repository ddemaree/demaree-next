This is bullshit: under Apple's "new" policy rejecting apps that ask/require users to have a paid subscription, even if the iOS app is clearly a companion UI to a mostly non-mobile product, [Readability](http://readability.com)'s app has been rejected. This is the first major reported instance of an app being rejected for failing to offer In App content purchases, and part of me thinks Readability won't bother resubmitting unless Apple makes a bold move back toward sanity.
