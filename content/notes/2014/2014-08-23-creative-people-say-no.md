<blockquote><p>Kevin Ashton:</p>

<blockquote>Saying “no” has more creative power than ideas, insights and talent combined. No guards time, the thread from which we weave our creations. The math of time is simple: you have less than you think and need more than you know. We are not taught to say “no.” We are taught <em>not</em> to say “no.” “No” is rude. “No” is a rebuff, a rebuttal, a minor act of verbal violence. “No” is for drugs and strangers with candy.</blockquote>

<p>I love and agree with everything about this post.</p></blockquote>
