  Maybe on Verizon the 'I-Phone' will work. But with even discounted prices is
  the phone really worth it? How many times do people really 'search the www' on
  thier phones? And when they do, what do they get... A web page cropped to fit
  on a phones display. Most folks just use thier phones to talk and text. I delt
  with a 'smart' phone for one year and found out that I used the 'web' function
  on the phone for such a small amount time it wasn't worth the cost! A dollar a
  day to read a 'phone web page version' of a newspaper was a neat idea for
  about a week. I found out that the version (of the newspaper) on my desktop
  was easier to read and a exact duplicate of the 'hard copy'. Texting was
  rarely used, I would text someone if it delt with a phone number or address so
  there would be no misunderstanding. The new 'subscriber' cost of $199 plus the
  monthly 'data and talk' fees makes it one expensive 'hard to read computer'!!

  "pks29733steel", a commenter on [this Time Magazine blog
  post](http://techland.time.com/2011/01/12/sorry-verizon-iphone-customers-early-upgrade-and-new-every-two-plans-ended/)
  about Verizon ending its "New Every Two" discounted upgrade program just
  before its version of the iPhone comes out in early February.


  I wonder if maybe this person has never used (or perhaps not even _seen_) an
  iPhone. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it's strange to have
  such a strongly negative opinion about something that's so much a part of the
  cultural zeitgeist based on 'facts' like these. Put another way: fixing
  complaints like these about mobile web browsing are practically _the whole
  point of the iPhone_.
