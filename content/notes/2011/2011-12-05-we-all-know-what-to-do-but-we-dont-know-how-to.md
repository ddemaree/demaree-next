  Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, [quoted by Jared Bernstein
  in a post about the ongoing Euro
  crisis](http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/two-points-re-the-euromess/). 


  Bernstein's post skirts the fact that [Juncker actually said that in
  _2005_](http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2011/12/quote-day-why-europe-still-mess),
  so it's not in response to anything happening now, but it seems a perfect
  catchphrase for why our smart, capable leaders more and more seem incapable of
  smart leadership.
