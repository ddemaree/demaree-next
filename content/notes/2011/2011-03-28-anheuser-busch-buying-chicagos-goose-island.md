For readers who aren't Chicagoans or beer fans (but who'd get a coffee reference), Goose Island is sort of like the beer version of Intelligentsia Coffee: local, independently owned, way too big to be called a "micro" brewery, but still putting out a quality product in spite of their growth. Of course, Goose Island is already bigger in beer than Intelligentsia is in coffeeâ€”you can't buy Intelligentsia at Target, but you can get Goose Island products.
