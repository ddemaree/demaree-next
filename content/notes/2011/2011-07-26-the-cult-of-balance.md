Paul Krugman:

> We have a crisis in which the right is making insane demands, while the president and Democrats in Congress are bending over backward to be accommodating — offering plans that are all spending cuts and no taxes, plans that are far to the right of public opinion.

> So what do most news reports say? They portray it as a situation in which both sides are equally partisan, equally intransigent — because news reports always do that. And we have influential pundits calling out for a new centrist party, a new centrist president, to get us away from the evils of partisanship.

> The reality, of course, is that we already have a centrist president — actually a moderate conservative president.

Not many of Obama's supporters — except the ones who've already labeled him a sell-out to a progressive cause he never _really_ claimed to be a part of — would think of him in these terms, as a conservative. But he is, in the long-forgotten literal sense of being slow to disruptive change, and preferring consensus over his own wants.

Not that anyone actually cares what words mean anymore.
