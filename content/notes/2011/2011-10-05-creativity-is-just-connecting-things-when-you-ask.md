  Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they
  did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it,
  they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s
  because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new
  things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they’ve had more
  experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other
  people.


  Unfortunately, that’s too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry
  haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to
  connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad
  perspective on the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human
  experience, the better design we will have.
