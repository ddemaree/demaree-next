This is pretty cool: the _NYT_ have released a new feature that lets you share links not only to individual stories/pages, but also to specific paragraphs or sentences within those stories. To use the feature you just double-press the shift key, then start clicking on the content you want to highlight. The result is a specially formatted URL in your address bar, which when opened by another user will show a highlight over the parts you selected.

For example, [here's a link to that article I just shared about the Chinese trucker, with a highlight over the part I quoted](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/world/asia/14china.html?_r=2#p[BhpOia],h[BhpOia,2,3]).

The code works on just about any _NYT_ content page, and their dev team has [released the Emphasis source code on GitHub](https://github.com/NYTimes/Emphasis).
