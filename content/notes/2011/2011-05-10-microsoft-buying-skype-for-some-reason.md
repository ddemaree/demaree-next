<a href="http://blog.onefps.net/post/5360781381" class="tumblr_blog">David Chartier</a> and some other folks are worried what this will mean for the Skype user experience on Apple platforms, but they may be overstating the problem somewhat. I mean, could Skype 5 for Mac really get any worse? The Office 2011 toolbar 'ribbon' may not be terribly Mac-like, but it's aggressively functional, and whoever designed it is obviously at least _competent_.

Skype doesn't seem like they should be worth anywhere near the $8.5 billion in cash Microsoft is paying to acquire them. But the reason why seems pretty simple: Microsoft is scared to death of Google, who are moving aggressively into the VoIP market (with Google Voice and Google Talk) and [who were reportedly another major bidder to buy Skype](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703730804576313932659388852.html?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTTopStories). This will not end well, but when faced with the prospect of a big competitor getting bigger, it's in Microsoft's nature to acquire first and ask questions later.
