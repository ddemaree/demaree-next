M.G. Siegler on why [calling Groupon a ponzi scheme](http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/groupon-groupon-ipo-tech-stocks-linked/6/3/2011/id/34936) <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/6187955938" class="tumblr_blog">misses the point of why they're chasing such an aggressive growth strategy</a>:

> If you look at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/02/groupon-growth-2-6-billion-revenue-run-rate-charts/">the actual breakdown</a>, most of the money is being spent internationally. In the U.S., they&#8217;re actually near break-even. If they can get a strong enough foothold and ensure Google and Facebook don&#8217;t run them over, they can pull back that spending substantially. And guess what will be left? A shit ton of money. Profit.
