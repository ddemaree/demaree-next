In short: _The King's Speech_ and _The Social Network_ got the most nominations. In _The Social Network_'s case, that includes well deserved ones for Jesse Eisenberg (Actor), Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross (Original Score), and of course, David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin.

And it's nice to see the Academy's people-pleasing strategy of including some people-pleasing blockbusters in their _freaking ten_ Best Picture nominees is still working out for them. The Picture nominees this year include the expected _Black Swan_, _True Grit_ and _127 Hours_, but also the less expected _Toy Story 3_ and _Inception_. (But Christopher Nolan was snubbed for Best Director. If he wants some love from the Academy I guess he'll need to make a reality- and morality-questioning _costume_ picture after he's done with Batman next year.)
