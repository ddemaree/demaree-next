Don't be fooled: Adobe hasn't released a standalone 'Photoshop for iPad' image/photo editing tool, but rather a suite of three add-ons that let you use your iPad as a control pad for Photoshop CS5 running on your desktop computer. Of the new apps [Adobe&reg; Eazel for Photoshop&reg;](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-eazel-for-photoshop/id421302663?mt=8#), which lets you finger-paint on your iPad screen then send the painted image to Photoshop (over Wi-Fi) for further editing and hi-res output, comes closest to being a standalone tool but doesn't offer much that Brushes HD or SketchBook Pro haven't already had for over a year.

On the other hand, [Adobe&reg; Color Lava for Photoshop&reg;](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-color-lava-for-photoshop/id417634383?mt=8#) — a touch-powered color mixer and palette maker — might actually be worth some money. (Maybe not the $3 they're charging, but definitely worth something.)
