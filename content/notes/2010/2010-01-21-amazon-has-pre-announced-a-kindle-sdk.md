Naturally, this being Amazon, it all sounds way more complicated than it needs to be:

> Active content will be available to customers in the Kindle Store later this year. Your active content can be priced three ways:

> * **Free** – Active content applications that are smaller than 1MB and use less than 100KB/user/month of wireless data may be offered at no charge to customers. Amazon will pay the wireless costs associated with delivery and maintenance.

> * **One-time Purchase** – Customers will be charged once when purchasing active content. Content must have nominal (less than 100KB/user/month) ongoing wireless usage.

> * **Monthly Subscription** – Customers will be charged once per month for active content.

> Active content applications have an upper size limit of 100MB. Applications larger than 10MB will not be delivered wirelessly but can be downloaded from the Kindle Store to a computer and transferred to the user's Kindle via USB.

Compare this with Apple's pricing structure: apps can be any size you want, priced however you want, with Apple always taking a 30% commission on sales. Of course, neither Apple nor iPhone OS developers have to pay for their customers' wireless usage.

They also pre-announced a new, more-Apple-like royalty split for publishers: where they currently get just 40% of sales, they'll now get 70% _minus delivery costs_, and only if they agree to certain other criteria (like enabling Kindle Text-to-Speech).

Sony and Barnes & Noble already have competing e-readers out, and Amazon hasn't blinked. Now Apple is merely _rumored_ to be _just announcing, not shipping_ one next Wednesday, and suddenly everything changes.

Next Wednesday is gonna be awesome.
