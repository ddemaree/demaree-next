The first developer beta of iOS 4.2—the first 4.x release that's compatible with the iPad—is now available to registered iOS Developer Program members. The new software will include a new wireless printing technology called 'AirPrint'; iOS devices (including iPhones and iPads) will be able to print to shared printers attached to their Macs/PCs, or directly to wireless printers (such as some new HP models shipping this Fall) that support the new protocol.
