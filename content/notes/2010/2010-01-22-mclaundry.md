Mark Vanhoenacker visits, compares and contrasts two icons of American food — Thomas Keller's French Laundry, and McDonalds — and finds them to be not all that different from each other:

> At McDonald's one is not likely to be served such French Laundry delights as a Tajine of Sweetbreads or Confit de Coeur de Veau. (And really it’s a pity to go through life without ever trying the Foie Gras en Terrine with K&J Orchard Peaches, Fennel Bulb and Yogurt Génoise.) Yet these are just the sorts of animal parts that fast-food restaurants have long been accused of stuffing into their burgers. Why is offal okay when Thomas Keller uses it?
>
> Both restaurants serve impressive pommes frites.
