So there's this thing called [the Dunning-Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect):

> A cognitive bias in which &#8220;people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it&#8221;. The unskilled therefore suffer from illusory superiority, rating their own ability as above average, much higher than in actuality; by contrast the highly skilled underrate their abilities, suffering from illusory inferiority.

> [Researchers] hypothesized that with a typical skill which humans may possess in greater or lesser degree,

> 1. Incompetent individuals tend to overestimate their own level of skill.
> 2. Incompetent individuals fail to recognize genuine skill in others.
> 3. Incompetent individuals fail to recognize the extremity of their inadequacy.
> 4. If they can be trained to substantially improve their own skill level, these individuals can recognize and acknowledge their own previous lack of skill.
