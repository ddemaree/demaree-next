Next on _Crazy Things Banned By Municipal Governments_: San Francisco is seriously considering a ban on pet sales (except fish, who don't count) within the city limits:

> The ban would include mice, rats, chinchillas, guinea pigs, birds, snakes, lizards and every other creature that the commission deems a "companion animal."

> In a packed meeting room last Thursday, the city's animal control and welfare commission heard testimony on the issue.

> "It's terrible. A pet store that can't sell pets? It's ridiculous," a local pet store owner told the Chronicle. "We'd have to close."
