Tomorrow Apple is opening [its second Chicago retail store](http://www.apple.com/retail/lincolnpark/), more than _seven years_ after [the existing Michigan Ave. location](http://www.apple.com/retail/northmichiganavenue/). That's seven years of Chicago residents having only one place to line up on iPhone day, only one Genius Bar to get repairs done. Seven years, during which time those undeserving jerkwads in NYC got not one, not two, but _three_ new locations. When the Michigan Ave. store opened Apple was still selling swivel-arm G4 iMacs and iPods didn't even have color screens yet.

Now, my fellow Chicagoans, vengeance is ours: the Apple Store, Lincoln Park is not only beautiful and conveniently located, it's Apple's fourth "Significant Store". The other three being those new locations in Shanghai, Paris and London that company execs have shown off proudly at their last two media events.
