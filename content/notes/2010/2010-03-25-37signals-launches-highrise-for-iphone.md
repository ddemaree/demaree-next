I've only used the app for a few minutes, but it's obvious how much thought they put into the design. The feature set and presentation are exactly right. And it's worth mentioning that now that it's on the iPhone, Highrise might be my new favorite task manager. It has email reminders, and since the to-dos live in the cloud they're available immediately across all my devices.
