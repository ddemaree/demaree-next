  When the Mac first came out, Newsweek asked me what I [thought] of it. I said:
  Well, it’s the first personal computer worth criticizing. So at the end of the
  presentation, Steve came up to me and said: Is the iPhone worth criticizing?
  And I said: Make the screen five inches by eight inches, and you’ll rule the
  world.

  In that interview he also said, "I bet a thousand dollars that they had a
  five-by-eight-inch version for the last couple years in-house."
