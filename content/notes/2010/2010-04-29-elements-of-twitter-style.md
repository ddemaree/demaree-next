Daniel Jalkut:

> Twitter’s 140 character limitation beguiles and infuriates its users. At its best, it forces users to come up with the most concise, purest of language expressions for their thoughts. At its worst, it leaves users “just a few characters shy” of pure genius. The advice in this section is intended to clarify how you can best embrace these constraints: work with them and not against them, and your audience will thank you.

At [Chirp](http://chirp.twitter.com/) I was disappointed not to see any sessions at all about how to make the most of that wonderful 140-character soapbox. But then, the fact that someone is passionate enough about Twitter to write a post like this is one of the many things that makes Twitter awesome.
