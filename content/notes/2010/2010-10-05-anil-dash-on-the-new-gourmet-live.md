Speaking of Condé Nast properties, internet hipsters, and the iPad: Anil Dash describes the all-star team of nerds (Paul Ford! Garrett Murray! Andre Torrez! Liz Spiers! And don't forget: Anil Dash!) who brought _Gourmet_ back as a "massively multiplayer magazine", a phrase he employs with _zero_ irony.

If you work on the Web and yet haven't heard of any of these people, that's fine. With the exception of Murray, they're all people who were A-list bloggers on the internet six or seven years ago when I was first starting out, back in those pre-Facebook days when being an "A-list blogger" meant being a snarky web developer in Brooklyn.

I don't mean to diminish these very talented and experienced folks' contributions to the Web we all know and love. But what this team has tried to do with _Gourmet Live_ is ambitious, and there are things about it that just do not make sense. For starters, why can't you e-mail or share anything, or invite friends to follow you, or do anything social on this obviously social-network-inspired app? Sure, you can have the app automatically post links to itself to Facebook or Twitter when you "unlock" a new magazine, but that's not a feedback loop—it's just me using my network to provide free advertising.

But, that bitching aside, the content is great. The recipes are well-written and sound delicious (I have two bookmarked for Fall dinners), the photos are gorgeous, and there's not much wrong with the user experience that can't be fixed in a decent version 1.1.
