Larry David gets to keep his Bush tax cuts, and with all the money he's saving he's gonna start buying real granola:

> The only problem is if, God forbid, the tax cuts are repealed in two years, how will I ever go back to Special K and bananas? Well, I did quit smoking, so I’m sure if push came to shove I could summon up the willpower to get off granola and blueberries. Of course, I suppose with the money I managed to save from the _Seinfeld_ syndication, I probably could continue to eat granola with blueberries, but let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.

David, you may recall, co-created _Seinfeld_, and that show's reruns have made him fabulously wealthy. He is probably one the last people on earth deserving of a tax break.
