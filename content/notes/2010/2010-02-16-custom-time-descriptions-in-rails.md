From the helpful dudes at [Thoughtbot](http://www.thoughtbot.com/): thanks to the new internationalization framework in Rails 2.2 and later, ends up you can easily override the text used by relative date/time helpers like `time_ago_in_words` by just adding some lines to your `locales/en.yml` file. Good to know!
