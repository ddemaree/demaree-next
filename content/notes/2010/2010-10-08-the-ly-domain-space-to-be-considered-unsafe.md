Short version: Ben Galbraith and his partner, sex blogger Violet Blue, were using `vb.ly` as a URL shortener for sexy web content and the Libyan government cancelled their domain registration. Additionally, the Libyans have decided to stop letting non-Libyans register `.ly` domains 3 characters or fewer in length, which means it's a good thing [Bit.ly](http://bit.ly/) has [that other domain of theirs](http://j.mp) to fall back on.
