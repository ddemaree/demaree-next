  It is possible that the public will not fall on the iPad, as I did, like lions
  on an antelope. Perhaps they will find the apps and the iBooks too expensive.
  Maybe they will wait for more fully featured later models. But for me, my iPad
  is like a gun lobbyist's rifle: the only way you will take it from me is to
  prise it from my cold, dead hands. One melancholy thought occurs as my fingers
  glide and flow over the surface of this astonishing object: Douglas Adams is
  not alive to see the closest thing to his _Hitchhiker's Guide_ that humankind
  has yet devised.
