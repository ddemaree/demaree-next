  The world is more addictive than it was 40 years ago. And unless the forms of
  technological progress that produced these things are subject to different
  laws than technological progress in general, the world will get more addictive
  in the next 40 years than it did in the last 40.


  The next 40 years will bring us some wonderful things. I don't mean to imply
  they're all to be avoided. Alcohol is a dangerous drug, but I'd rather live in
  a world with wine than one without. Most people can coexist with alcohol; but
  you have to be careful. More things we like will mean more things we have to
  be careful about.


  Most people won't, unfortunately. Which means that as the world becomes more
  addictive, the two senses in which one can live a normal life will be driven
  ever further apart. One sense of "normal" is statistically normal: what
  everyone else does. The other is the sense we mean when we talk about the
  normal operating range of a piece of machinery: what works best.

  it'll be when iPhone 10 comes out.
