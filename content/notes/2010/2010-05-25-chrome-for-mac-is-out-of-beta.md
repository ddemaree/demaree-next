<p>From David Chartier at Macworld:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chrome for Mac left beta at the rather unceremonious version number of 5.0.375.55. It boasts many of Chromeâ€™s most popular cross-platform features too, including syncing of both bookmarks and browser preferences (like themes, homepage settings, preferred languages, and even page zoom settings), and a full-screen mode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recent dev builds have seemed a bit flaky, but Chrome is a wonderful browser and hopefully this means Google&#8217;s worked out enough bugs for it to be usable day to day, even for serious businessmen like myself.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://googlemac.blogspot.com/2010/05/google-chrome-for-mac-ready-beta-now.html">the official announcement</a>.</p>
