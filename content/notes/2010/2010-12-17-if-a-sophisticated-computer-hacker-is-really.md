  If a sophisticated computer hacker is really determined to crack into my life,
  then they’re likely to be able to do so. Using stronger passwords will slow
  them down, but it won’t stop them. The most common password in the Gawker set
  — 123456 — was used by just 3,000 of 1.5 million people, which is 0.2% of
  them. If you’re trying to guess my password, using brains rather than
  computer-assisted brawn, it won’t be easy, even if it’s in the dictionary
  somewhere. And if you’re using computer brawn to try to crack into my life,
  I’ve likely got bigger problems than having insecure passwords.

  [Felix Salmon's thoughts on password
  security](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2010/12/14/why-passwords-are-insecure/)
  are more or less the same as mine. 


  The risk that any one password will be compromised is why you're supposed to
  use "secure" passwords, with a jumbled mix of letters, numbers and punctuation
  symbols. But keeping someone from guessing a single password isn't the danger,
  and isn't why the Gawker breach is so serious. Your password can be
  unguessable and uncrackable, but if you use the same uncrackable password
  _everywhere_ and one of the places you've used it is compromised, then
  everything you do online is compromised.


  The only "solutions", such as they are, are to either:


  1. Use a different password for every web site, which means you have to invent
  one every time you sign up for a website, and have some secure way of
  remembering or logging those new passwords. 99% of people are not going to do
  this.


  2. Use a trusted identity provider, like a Google, Facebook or Twitter
  account, and use _that_ to log into third party sites. This approach has it's
  own problems, but it's moot because 99% of web sites don't support this kind
  of federated login.

  standard, hasn't taken over the
  world](http://www.quora.com/What-s-wrong-with-OpenID).
