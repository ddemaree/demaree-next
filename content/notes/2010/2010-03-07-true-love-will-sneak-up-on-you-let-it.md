  [Alex Payne](http://al3x.net/2010/03/02/hiatus.html), who's getting married
  next week to a lady it turns out he met on [OkCupid](http://www.okcupid.com/).


  I don't know Alex—though we did meet once at RailsConf, back in my "fat
  dorkwad" phase—but he's a quality gentleman, and his OkCupid experience sounds
  pretty consistent with mine.
