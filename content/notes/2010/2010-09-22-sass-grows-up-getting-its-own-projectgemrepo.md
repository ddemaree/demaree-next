Sass—an amazing CSS stylesheet pre-processor written in Ruby—is graduating from being part of [the Haml project](http://github.com/nex3/haml) to having its own [GitHub repo](http://github.com/nex3/sass) and [gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/sass). It's not exactly a split; as far as I know the same developers will continue to work on both projects (though it will now be possible for one to contribute to Sass without also having to deal with Haml). It's more of a reorganization that should make Sass easier for new users to install and use, which I think is a great idea.
