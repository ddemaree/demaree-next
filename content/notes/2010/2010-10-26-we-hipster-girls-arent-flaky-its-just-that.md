  [We hipster girls] aren't flaky, it's just that often times something better
  comes up. Sure, on a Monday afternoon it sounds like a great idea to go see
  the new 3D Wes Craven movie with you this weekend. But on Saturday afternoon
  we all of a sudden remember our friend's art opening is that night and then
  Sarah texts about this loft party where the guy from our favorite band
  Slaughtered Twin's new side project Half Absorbed Twin Fetus is playing their
  first ever show, and, well, we're not going to miss that.


  On a related note, sorry about not returning your phone call. Next time text,
  email, IM, Facebook or direct-message at us. We'll probably respond in a few
  minutes, instead of the week it took us to realize you'd left us a voicemail.

  friends are _impossible_ to try to hang out with.
