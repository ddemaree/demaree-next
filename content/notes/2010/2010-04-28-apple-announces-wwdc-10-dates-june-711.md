First thing I thought when I saw this: "huh, so for all that trouble Gizmodo only beat the iPhone 4G announcement by what, 7 weeks?" (It's expected Steve Jobs will announce the next iPhone at WWDC, as he's done the last two years in a row.)

Tickets are $1,599, and _will_ sell out. Also worth noting: this year Apple Design Awards will be given out for iPhone and iPad apps, but _not_ for Mac apps.
