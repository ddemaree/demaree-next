  [John] Gruber says that when he’s writing Daring Fireball, he’s picturing his
  ideal reader — a copy of himself — and conceptually writing just for him. With
  everything he writes, he’s writing to and for that one ideal reader, not
  trying to boost his SEO for target phrases or appeal to an ever broadening
  demographic.


  Well, I do the same thing, except that my ideal reader is John Gruber. That
  works pretty well, in the sense that I try to reach a high enough quality
  standard to match my perception of his.

  blogging.


  As for how he finds time to make Instapaper happen while also working
  full-time for Tumblr:


  > Managing my time is trickier. The short answer is that I cherry-pick:
  Instapaper is a collection of fairly simple things. I don’t do anything for it
  that requires massive amounts of time, because I simply don’t have enough time
  to do that. It usually ends up taking 4-8 hours per week, which fits easily
  into a few evenings or a single weekend day.


  Considering how great Instapaper is, and how quickly Marco is able to iterate
  despite having just hours a week to work on it, maybe more of us should be
  finding ways not to do things that require "massive amounts of time."
