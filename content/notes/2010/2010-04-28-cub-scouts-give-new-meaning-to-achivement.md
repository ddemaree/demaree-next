The Boy Scouts of America now offer 'Video Games' awards for Tiger, Cub and Webelos Scouts. Among the criteria:

> * With your parents, create a plan to buy a video game that is right for your age group.

> * Compare two game systems (for example, Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation, Nintendo Wii, and so on). Explain some of the differences between the two. List good reasons to purchase or use a game system.

> * List at least five tips that would help someone who was learning how to play your favorite video game.

> * Choose a game you might like to purchase. Compare the price for this game at three different stores. Decide which store has the best deal. In your decision, be sure to consider things like the store return policy and manufacturerâ€™s warranty.

Like the saying says: if you can't beat 'em, give up completely and start giving prizes for 'em.
