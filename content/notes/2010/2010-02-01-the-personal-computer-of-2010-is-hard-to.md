  The personal computer of 2010 is hard to understand for novices and people who
  struggle with abstract concepts. Macs, PCs, all of them. Folks, it’s us, the
  freaks who understand drive partitioning, regular expressions, virtual disk
  images, task switching, and shell scripting — we’re the exception. So while we
  trump up our skills at designing “easy to use” interfaces for our
  applications, millions of people are still trying to figure out how to get our
  beautifully designed application out of its zip file or disk image. Or where
  in fact the Downloads folder is. Or what, exactly, a folder is.
