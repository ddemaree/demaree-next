  That's a gift that the audience gave us, to be able to do the show as we did.
  To sit down at episode eight and start to talk about what you're going to do
  in the second season ... The guys doing <cite>FlashForward</cite>, for
  example, were being asked about the second season at the upfront last year.
  It's good to have a plan, but at the same time the most important plan is
  making the next episode really good. That's the only job that Carlton and I
  and everybody else on this show has ever had.
