Release notes? Funny, I didn't hear anything about a Rails 3 developer preview, alpha or beta release. In fact, seeing as Edge Rails requires [Bundler 0.9](http://github.com/carlhuda/bundler) which, afaik, _also_ has not been released, it's actually _further_ from release today than it was last week.

> Rails 3.0 is a landmark release as it delivers on the Merb/Rails merge promise made in December 2008. Rails 3.0 provides major upgrades to all of the components of Rails, including a complete overhaul of the router and query APIs.

Rails Core, I'm really happy for y'all and imma let you finish, but can you _please please please_ spend less time writing blog posts and detailed release notes for Rails 3 until you manage to _actually release Rails 3_?

Or, if that's too hard, can you try to make it so "getting started with Rails 3" blog posts you read last week are still at least somewhat usable this week? Please?
