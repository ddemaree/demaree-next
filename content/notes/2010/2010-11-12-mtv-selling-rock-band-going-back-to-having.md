Less than three weeks after the launch of _Rock Band 3_, the latest installment in a franchise most of us thought was a smash hit, Harmonix is being put up for sale by Viacom/MTV Games. And _Wired_'s interpretation of Viacom's balance sheet implies that it's not because they just got bored of being in the video game business:

> To use the popular Internet acronym: IANAA (I am not an accountant) but there does seem to be some telling info in the financial statement linked above. Viacom mentioned that Harmonix has been shifted to the “discontinued operations” section of its balance sheet. That section shows a $37 million loss for the first nine months of 2009, and a $321 million loss for the first nine months of 2010.

> We don’t know what other operations are in that category. But if you go back to last quarter’s financial statement, you can see that the “discontinued operations” segment sans Harmonix was nonexistent in 2009 and turning a tiny, single-digit profit in 2010.

The only things that were new in the _Rock Band_ universe during that time (prior to the release of _RB3_) were the special Beatles and Green Day editions. One big change since last year's release of _The Beatles Rock Band_ is that whereas Harmonix used to design and manufacture the various guitar/drum controllers themselves, that has now been jobbed out to Mad Catz. I'll also note that while my local Best Buy was packed with both _RB2_ and _Beatles Rock Band_ hardware last year, this year I can't find a single _Rock Band_-branded controller except for the brand-new _RB3_ keytar.

So, my theory: Harmonix's software business is more or less sound—it's their hardware business (i.e., trying to make, ship and sell gigantic $200 full-band sets during a global recession) that did them in.
