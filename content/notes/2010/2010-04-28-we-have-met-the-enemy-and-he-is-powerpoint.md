Think _your_ office is too reliant on PowerPoint decks? Could be worse, you could be trying to manage U.S. military operations:

> Like an insurgency, PowerPoint has crept into the daily lives of military commanders and reached the level of near obsession. The amount of time expended on PowerPoint, the Microsoft presentation program of computer-generated charts, graphs and bullet points, has made it a running joke in the Pentagon and in Iraq and Afghanistan.

From the article it sounds like the problem isn't PowerPoint so much as PowerPoint abuse: bullet lists are horrible information design, and decks full of bullets are going to be awful whether they're used in a boardroom or in a forward base in Afghanistan.
