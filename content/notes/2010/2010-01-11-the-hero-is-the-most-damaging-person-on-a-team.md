  The hero is the most damaging person on a team, &hellip; If you’ve built a
  system that’s supposed to be reliable, you shouldn’t be up fixing it at four
  in the morning. You shouldn’t be getting paged at all hours. Sure, you might
  need to do some occasional planned after-hours maintenance, or some very
  occasional unplanned-but-process-driven disaster recovery, but you _shouldn’t
  need a hero._
