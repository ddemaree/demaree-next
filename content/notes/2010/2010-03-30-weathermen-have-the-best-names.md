Clay Risen found the ten best weatherman names in America. The intro:

> Think of every TV news team you’ve ever watched. Lead anchor: John, vaguely Midwestern, definitely tanned. Co-anchor: Julie the Blonde/Vaguely Asian or Hispanic. Sports: Hank. Maybe Bill. Or Bob. But only sometimes. Otherwise, Hank. Normal, all-American names, for all-American people, delivering all-American news. But then there’s the person standing at stage left, dwarfed by a giant map of North America. His name? Flip. Topper. Storm. He’s the weatherman.

Until reading this, had completely forgotten that there once _really was_ a Weather Channel anchor named "Hannah Storm."
