Whoa:

> While televisions have transformed from bulky and boxy to slim and sleek over the last decade, one thing hasn't changed. The basics of displaying color on TVs still derive from the same three fundamental building blocks: red, green and blue.

> In what Sharp Corp. is calling a "revolutionary" breakthrough, the company says it has developed a way to add a fourth primary color, yellow, to the mix. By doing so, Sharp says its new flagship televisions—hitting the market in two months—will display more than a trillion colors, about 1,000 times more color than current models.

This _might_ be a bigger deal than Apple releasing a new kind of media gadget.
