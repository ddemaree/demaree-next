Nikon's finally announced their new "enthusiast"/prosumer DSLR model (and successor to my beloved D90), the D7000. Features include a 16 megapixel sensor, 1080p HD video, two SD card slots and 39 point autofocus. It goes on sale next month for $1199 (body-only) or $1499 (with a 18-105mm VR zoom lens).
