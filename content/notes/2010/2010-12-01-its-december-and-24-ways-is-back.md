24 Ways, "the advent calendar for Web geeks", is back with an article by Drew McLellan on progressive enhancement for embedded maps. There's always tons of good stuff posted here during the holiday season. Highly recommended for people who make web sites.

This year, for people who prefer their learning materials in dead-tree format, Five Simple Steps is publishing a [24 Ways Annual](http://fivesimplesteps.com/books/the-24-ways-annual-2010) containing all 24 articles, now up for pre-order for just 8 GBP (about $12.50), with all proceeds benefiting Unicef.
