  <p>That happy outcome aside, there’s a farcical aspect to the process.</p>


  <p>There’s a program that Congress never approved. The House weirdly had to
  vote to get rid of it. They did so. But the Senate had to follow suit, voting
  to get rid of the program that they never passed. And they failed even though
  57 Senators were in favor. So an illegal program will continue, despite
  majorities in both houses of Congress casting votes to end what they never
  began. And the only reason their failure doesn’t matter is that legal
  provisions that don’t in fact authorize the program will soon expire. And then
  it will end. What a strange democracy we’ve got.</p>
