<p>Facebook got a lot of criticism when their&nbsp;“Year in Review” feature (a thing to produce a fun, breezy summary of events from your year, generated from the year’s Timeline posts) turned out to <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/12/24/inadvertent-algorithmic-cruelty/">commit random acts of algorithmic cruelty</a>. You would think they'd have learned something from that experience, and lay off attempting a sequel until they could somehow solve the problems Eric Meyer and others had with the feature.</p><p>Ha ha j/k this is Facebook. <i>Of course</i>&nbsp;they learned nothing, and are already right back at it.</p>
