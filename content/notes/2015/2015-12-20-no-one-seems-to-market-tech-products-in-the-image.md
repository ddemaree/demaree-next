  No one seems to market tech products in the image of the most famous virtual
  assistant in film history. Hal from “2001: A Space Odyssey” was so brilliant
  and manly that it attempted to kill off the crew of the spacecraft it was
  built to manage. Instead, people build what I call “Stepford apps.” These are
  the Internet’s answer to those old sci-fi robots in dresses mopping floors
  with manufactured enthusiasm.


  The Amazon Echo voice-activated home-automation system is another
  Stepford-style device, with a woman’s voice and name, Alexa. Of course
  consumer reviews on the website either praise or complain about “her” with the
  feminine pronoun. A friend of mine who owns the device told me, “Sometimes I
  wish she’d just shut up.” If my friend says “weather” in the middle of a
  conversation, the device might interject — “Right now in New York it is 45
  degrees …”


  Alexa sounds like a nag. Now I’m using sexist language to dismiss a gadget.
  Imagine if the plug-in devices that made housework more efficient were, like
  Alexa, sold with women’s names and talked about with female pronouns. “Could
  you hand me the Amanda? She’s in the hall closet.” “Please clean the Sarah
  when you’re finished with the onions.” “The Emily is broken.” That could
  easily lead to characterizing an overflowing dishwasher as a “bubbly,”
  garrulous woman, or a microwave slowing down because of “her” age.
