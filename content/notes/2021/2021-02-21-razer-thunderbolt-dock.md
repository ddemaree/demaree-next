Last week I got [Razer's new Thunderbolt 4 dock](https://www.razer.com/gaming-pc-accessories/Razer-Thunderbolt-4-Dock-Chroma/RC21-01690100-R3U1), which seems very much the sort of hub [Intel had in mind when they introduced the USB4 and Thunderbolt 4 standards](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/8/21317513/intel-thunderbolt-4-standard-docks-cables-usb4-accessories-port-usbc) — a rather expensive black metal box with four full-speed Thunderbolt 4 ports, plus Gigabit Ethernet, an SD reader, and some classic USB-A ports for keyboards and such.

Something that may take getting used to about Thunderbolt 4 is that this hub, and others like it from vendors like Kensington, don't have video ports — like, at all. To hook a display up to one of these you need to plug it in using a dongle, or else get a display that has a direct Thunderbolt or USB-C connection. Right now, I have my monitor plugged into the hub using a HDMI-to-USB-C adapter, which seems to work fine.

For me, the main benefit to this Razer hub is that it provides a full 90W of power to my MacBook Pro, so it will charge even if I'm running it ragged all day with nonstop video conferencing. I also could swear my computer runs cooler and quieter than with my CalDigit hub; that could be my imagination, but it could also be HDMI vs DisplayPort video, or something to do with the computer getting enough power to run for once in its life.

Sadly, the most _fun_ feature of the Razer Thunderbolt Dock — customizable RGB lighting on its bottom edge — is only customizable on Windows PCs running the newest version of Razer's Synapse software. Apparently, Razer has no plans to make Synapse 3 available on macOS ([which folks on customer forums are not happy about](https://insider.razer.com/index.php?threads/synapse-3-mac-support.61592/)), which is rather a dealbreaker for using keyboards and mice.
