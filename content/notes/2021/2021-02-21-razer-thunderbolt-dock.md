Last week I got [Razer's new Thunderbolt 4 dock](https://www.razer.com/gaming-pc-accessories/Razer-Thunderbolt-4-Dock-Chroma/RC21-01690100-R3U1), which seems very much the sort of hub [Intel had in mind when they introduced the USB4 and Thunderbolt 4 standards](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/8/21317513/intel-thunderbolt-4-standard-docks-cables-usb4-accessories-port-usbc) — a rather expensive black metal box with four full-speed Thunderbolt 4 ports, plus Gigabit Ethernet, an SD reader, and some classic USB-A ports for keyboards and such.

This hub, and others like it from vendors like Kensington, don't have video ports, which I think is a bit weird. As it happens my HP Z27 display has a USB-C port, so I can hook it up directly to the hub. But other displays that rely on HDMI or DisplayPort hookups will need an adapter, in addition to the $320 cost of the hub.

As it happens, this setup has the potential to work well for me — it'll let me use both the hub and my display's USB ports, the hub provides 90W of power to my MacBook which is _almost_ the full 96W that comes from its power brick, and it has fun colored lights. I like fun lights!
