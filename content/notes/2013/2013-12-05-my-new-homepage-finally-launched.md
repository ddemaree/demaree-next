It has seriously taken me _years_ to get this done, and now it's done.

I could go to my usual insane level of detail explaining how the new website came to be, what tools I used, the thinking behind my two web font choices. But I think for now it's enough to point out just three really important things.

First, the new site is powered by the awesome static site publishing CMS [Siteleaf](http://siteleaf.com). I started playing with one of their free developer accounts last week, right before Thanksgiving, and the finished site launched today. Siteleaf made it really, really easy to organize my content and make it editable, and their local development workflow for building out a site's templates is just so well done. What's most exciting about using Siteleaf isn't the site you see today, but that it gives me a really nice platform on which to grow. This is the first launch for the new demaree.me; it won't be the last.

Second, I'm very proud of the new Talks section, because I'm very proud of the talks I've given over the past two years and I've wanted a better way to collect videos, slides, and other materials about them for a while. I'm going to keep adding new talks as I give them, and will be going back to add older ones as I find videos for them online.

Finally, it's a responsive site (of course), but I found I didn't really love any of the common patterns for mobile-friendly responsive navigation. But I _do_ love iOS 7's "layering" concept for modal states and the springboard, especially the way Tweetbot has executed it with underlying layers very, very clearly shifting back in space when a modal dialog is open. So I decided to pay homage to that with my mobile navigation. Check out the site on an iPhone and you'll see what I mean. It's nifty (and 99% CSS).
