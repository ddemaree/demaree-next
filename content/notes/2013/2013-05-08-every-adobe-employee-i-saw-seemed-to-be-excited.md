  Every Adobe employee I saw seemed to be excited, happy, and on-board with the
  mission. I see that kind of energy at good startups and small studios. I never
  see it in big corporations. It sometimes seemed to me that Adobe hadnâ€™t so
  much acquired Typekit as the reverse: that the people and thinking behind
  Typekit are now running Adobe (which is actually true), and that the mindset
  of some of the smartest consultants and designers in our industry is now
  driving a huge corporation.
