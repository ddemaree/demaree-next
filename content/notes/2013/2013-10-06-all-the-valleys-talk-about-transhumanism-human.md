  <p>All the Valley’s talk about transhumanism, human potential, life extension,
  and generally “changing the world” is a bunch of hooey. It’s a myth — in the
  pejorative sense of that term. It’s a fluffy religion meant to snooker young
  professionals into giving their employers everything they have and working
  their brains down to the myelin until they become too old to be relevant
  anymore.</p>


  <p>No, it’s worse than that.</p>


  <p>They don’t get too old to be relevant. They get too old to be cheap.</p>

  If nothing else, it's a shame Silicon Valley has optimized itself for things
  you can do with, at most, 5-10 years of experience. It seems a lot of startup
  culture has organized around the theory that the idea is everything, and the
  *awesomest* ideas come when you're young. America's whole technology
  infrastructure is shifting toward implementing stuff 19-25 year olds think is
  cool. (Not useful, not problem-solving—those things are at best side effects
  or by-products of the endless quest for cool.) 


  If you want to know why we don't haven't cured cancer or invented cold fusion
  or built a transit system that'd make the Hyperloop look as insane as it is,
  that is why. Because developing technology on the scale of a whole society
  requires wisdom and experience. It requires *mastery*. Our technology culture
  claims to value mastery, but instead of developing a whole industry of
  masterful 45 and 50 year olds, we're driving those folks out of the business
  in favor of looking for a few prodigious 22 year olds.


  Low-end disruption (doing the same thing we're already doing, but cheaper and
  on a wider scale) is good for business, but it's not how societies progress.
  And optimizing a whole industry around the best and brightest youthful talent
  smells like a form of low-end disruption. Silicon Valley is just innovative
  enough to get by, and its labor costs are way lower than they could be if the
  older engineers were encouraged to stay involved.
