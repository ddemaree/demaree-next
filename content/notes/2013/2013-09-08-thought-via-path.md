I'll be honest with you, Pathers: I'm bad at social networking, at least at the bi-directional kind like Facebook and Path. I like Twitter because it's easy, and part of what makes it easy is that friendships are one-way. On Twitter we're all individuals publishing things out to the ether, trusting that among the masses are some of our friends who will see and appreciate them, perhaps hoping that there are also strangers who will also like to hear what I'm about today. 

Private networks like Facebook are weird because they tend to either flatten people out ("omg my parents are here I can't ever post the word 'fuck' or a pro-Obamacare link again") or give them license to overshare (because a private audience can be assumed to be a friendly audience?). Google+, BTW, avoids this problem via self-selection: if you use Google+ you're probably a *huge* nerd, someone who's very concerned about privacy and control who nonetheless has a very narrow band of interests and is probably speaking to other people in the same narrow band.

Path seems to avoid this problem (so far) by de-emphasizing text. It's (IMO) simpler and more intuitive to post a *thing* — a photo, a check-in, what music you're listening to — than a status update about your life. Interestingly, it doesn't seem like those *things* include links. Unlike Twitter, Facebook, and most other social thingies, Path seems totally ambivalent to having people share links to content outside Path.

Also unlike other platforms, Path either doesn't have an API for sending or cross-posting content from other places, or people are so uninterested that no one does it. (AFAIK, the answer is that Path does limit write access to itself, Nike, and maybe 1-2 other partners.)

I think these are big contributing factors to why Path feels so much… calmer than other social feeds. It's (as it says on the tin) a series of intimate moments from your friends' lives. It's closed in the sense that it's not public, and also in the sense that all the various forms of content are heavily curated or mediated by Path or their apps. Clearly text posts are allowed, but they kind of go against the grain. 

Of course, it's also that very few people are actually using Path, and when they do it's for brief moments, like to check in or post a photo. What I'm trying to get at it, I think these things go hand in hand. Path just doesn't behave the way we expect a social medium to behave. It's not a place where you can share a link to your new product, or a YouTube video you love, or make a political rant. You could do these things, but it'd be like playing a boom box in a library or art gallery. Whether that's a good thing or not remains to be seen. 

For my part, if I let go of worrying about being That Guy Who Uses Path For Some Reason, I *like* seeing people's Nike stats or pictures from their morning bike ride. Maybe it's something about my specific Path network, but this just feels like a more chill and humble social feed. I don't feel like every other post is trying to show me how much cooler you are or how much more fun you're having. The story of this feed isn't about a bunch of people demonstrating their lives, it's little, modest pieces of lives that are being graciously shared.

I think I'll try to come around here more often, and we'll see how it goes. at Schloß Weinmaree – Read on <a href='https://path.com/p/1vivuw'>Path</a>.
