  [ESPN's Sean
  Bratches](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/05/apple-tv-could-make-espn-another-trick-in-its-bag/),
  speaking fluent TV Executivese to Bloomberg. 


  What he's trying to say is "sure, we'd love to offer live streams of ESPN
  content on Apple TV to people who are already paying for ESPN through their
  cable subscription, if Apple's into that kind of thing." Hope he's not holding
  his breath.
