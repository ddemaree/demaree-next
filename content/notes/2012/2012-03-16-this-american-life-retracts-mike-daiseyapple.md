In short, Daisey made shit up. Not everything, but _TAL_ aired the piece on the basic assumption that things in it were true that it turns out were not. [This weekend's new episode of _TAL_](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/460/retraction) is a full hour detailing the errors in the original story, which were originally uncovered by a reporter for _Marketplace_.

Daisey has [posted a statement on his blog](http://mikedaisey.blogspot.com/2012/03/statement-on-tal.html).
