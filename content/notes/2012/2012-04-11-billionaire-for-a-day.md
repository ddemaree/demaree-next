The NYT's Kevin Roose lives like the 1% for a day, and reports back:

> I’m outfitted for the day in a navy pinstripe suit, picked out by Clifton C. Berry, who outfits Wall Street workers with his own line of bespoke menswear. It’s probably the best I’ve looked all year. But I’m way overdressed for a meeting with the billionaire, who is wearing a sweater, jeans and sockless loafers.
>
> During the trip, I ask the billionaire what it’s like to be among the richest people in the world.
>
> “Look,” he says. “I think all it does is make things easier.”

Understatement of the year.
