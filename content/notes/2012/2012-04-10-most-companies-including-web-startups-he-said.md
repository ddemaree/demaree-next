  Most companies (including web startups), he said, are looking to “wow” with
  their products, when in reality what they should be looking for is an “‘of
  course’ reaction from their users.”


  Puzzled, I looked at him. And then it hit me: Great design means that one look
  and the end user reacts by knowing what to do with a knob or a button, without
  as much as even thinking about it. Of course this knob is what turns the
  volume up, or brings up the home screen.

  The problem with [this unsolicited redesign of
  Typekit](http://dribbble.com/shots/484808-Typekit-Concept) from a couple of
  weeks ago is that, like a lot of unsolicited redesigns, it mistakes a lack of
  "wow" for a design problem, which the guy solves by adding more popovers,
  making the gradients eye-searingly bright, and taking over the four corners of
  the viewport in a very app-like, un-web-like, fashion. But "wow" usually isn't
  the solution to a real design problem. Usually, if a design is successful, it
  shouldn't seem _designed_ at all.
