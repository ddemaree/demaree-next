Ryan Tomayko on how he manages engineers at GitHub:

> I actually don't show people how to make decisions and ship product in any real direct way. There's no How To Ship Product training class or anything like that. Instead, I just do work.

> I write down ideas and then market them internally. I ask designers about their comps and concept work. I write code with kick ass docs and tests, sometimes while building out the backend for a feature and sometimes just to clean shit up because it needs it. I deploy responsibly because site stability is job number zero. I soft ship new features and try to get other employees to use them. I write and review blog posts and ship features. I fix bugs. I work with support.

> That's just how you ship software product in 2012.
