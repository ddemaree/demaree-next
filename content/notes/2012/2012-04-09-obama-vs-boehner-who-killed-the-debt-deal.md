Matt Bai tells the long, sad story of last summer's initially promising but ultimately failed debt negotiations between John Boehner and the White House.  In short, it seems the main reason Obama administration should have been less eager to make a deal was because the only people sane enough to negotiate with them (e.g. Boehner, who I wouldn't previously have described as "sane") were in no position to promise anything.
