I've been beta testing this new version for weeks, and pretty much everything Blanc writes is accurate. This is a major upgrade that makes reading RSS feeds on your iPhone a lot nicer. [Available now on the App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder/id325502379?mt=8) for $3; current users can upgrade for free.
