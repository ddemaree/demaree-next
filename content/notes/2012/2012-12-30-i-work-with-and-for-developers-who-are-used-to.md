  I work with and for developers who are used to developing server-side
  components. It drives me bananas when I mention something off-hand about iOS
  development and they look at me like I’m crazy. Or if I give out an estimate
  they think is ridiculous, I have to justify the time I will need to spend on
  such-and-such a feature.

  <p>This sort of thing crosses my mind when I read about the ongoing fight over
  design patterns and object oriented crap currently being waged in the Ruby
  community—web developers, perhaps especially Rubyists, often just don&#8217;t
  know how good we have it. Lots of developers have to spend a day doing simple
  things because their platform doesn't give them a faster way to do them. Our
  platforms (Ruby, or more generally the Web) give us something like
  <em>five</em> faster ways, and consequently we spend the time that would have
  gone toward grunt work arguing over which of those five ways is the most
  correct one.</p> <p>Similarly, we&#8217;re so used to the ability to do
  amazing things quickly that a verbose language/platform like Cocoa just looks
  <em>wrong</em>, like because we don&#8217;t need to write seven lines of code
  to render a button, it&#8217;s strange and stupid for <em>anyone</em> to have
  to, which is simply not the case. I always enjoy spending time in Objective-C
  because it reminds me that code can look different, and non-minimal, and yet
  still be good code.</p>
