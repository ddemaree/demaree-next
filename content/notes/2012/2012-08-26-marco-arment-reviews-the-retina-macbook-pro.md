He calls it the best computer he's ever used. And he's a hardcore Mac Pro devotee, one of those guys who wants a 12-core monstrosity at home and the tiniest possible Air on the go.

Last week work surprised me with an upgrade to a souped-up rMBP (not even the base model, like Marco's—mine has *16 freaking GB of memory*) and I concur with everything he says. I want to write more about my experience having used it for a week or two—it's a hell of a machine.
