Jeff Atwood writes about the deeply frustrating "everyone should learn to code" movement, which also frustrates me because it feels symptomatic of a broader trend: a general cultural focus on _how_ software is made over _why_ we make it.

So much of the conversation in programmer circles focuses on things like methodologies, principles, or design patterns. These things are valuable as tools to help craft better code, in the same way that _The Elements of Style_ helps one write better prose, but code isn't good because it's DRY or SOLID any more than a novel is good because the writer demonstrates good subject-verb agreement. Talking to fellow programmers sometimes feels too much like going to a seminar on the correct way to use a comma. (Or [a semicolon](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/3057), as it may be.) More code is not a solution for anything.
