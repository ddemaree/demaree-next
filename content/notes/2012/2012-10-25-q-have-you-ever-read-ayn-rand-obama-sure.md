  <p>Q: Have you ever read Ayn Rand?</p>


  <p>Obama: Sure.</p>


  <p>Q: What do you think Paul Ryan&#8217;s obsession with her work would mean
  if he were vice president?</p>


  <p>Obama: Well, you&#8217;d have to ask Paul Ryan what that means to him. Ayn
  Rand is one of those things that a lot of us, when we were 17 or 18 and
  feeling misunderstood, we&#8217;d pick up. Then, as we get older, we realize
  that a world in which we&#8217;re only thinking about ourselves and not
  thinking about anybody else, in which we&#8217;re considering the entire
  project of developing ourselves as more important than our relationships to
  other people and making sure that everybody else has opportunity – that
  that&#8217;s a pretty narrow vision. It&#8217;s not one that, I think,
  describes what&#8217;s best in America. Unfortunately, it does seem as if
  sometimes that vision of a &#8220;you&#8217;re on your own&#8221; society has
  consumed a big chunk of the Republican Party</p>
