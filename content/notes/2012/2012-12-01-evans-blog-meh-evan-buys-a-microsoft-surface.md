<blockquote>
<p>I bought a Microsoft Surface yesterday. Long story, don’t ask why, it wasn’t for me.</p>
<p>This is the story of the purchase.</p>
<p>It started with a phone call to the Microsoft Pop-Up store at the Shops at Columbus Circle…</p>
<p>Evan: “Hi, do you have any Surface tablets in stock”</p>
<p>Sales Rep: “Yes, plenty!”</p>
<p>&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>One gets the distinct impression Microsoft never considered their stores to actually be, y&#8217;know, <em>stores</em>, not just big, expensive, interactive ads. To wit: the Microsoft pop-up store at the North Bridge mall in Chicago has no signage that would tell people there&#8217;s an actual store where you can try, and buy, a Surface. Now, there are *tons* of Surface images and logos around the building, but they&#8217;re indistinguishable from regular Surface advertisements—there&#8217;s not even a caption or tag line saying &#8220;come visit the Microsoft Holiday Store at 540 North Michigan&#8221;.</p>
