  The tension is between simplicity and obviousness. Eliminating on-screen
  chrome is simpler, more elegant and beautiful. But Appleâ€™s use of minimal but
  persistent on-screen chrome makes things more obvious. Big differences can

  tech-savvy, obviousness might be a better choice than extreme simplicity.
