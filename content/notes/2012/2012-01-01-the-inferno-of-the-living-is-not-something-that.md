  The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it
  is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by
  being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy
  for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no
  longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and
  apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the
  inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.
