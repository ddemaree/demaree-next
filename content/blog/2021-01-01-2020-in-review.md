2020 was a heavy, dark, horrible year, an _annus horribilis_ for almost every living person. But all told it wasn't _so_ bad for me and my family.

A year ago I wrote [this 2019 review post](/p/2019-in-review), and it's almost cute what small things I was thinking about then. Lots of travel, lots of chatter about my cool office and my new gym routine, lots of wishing for more of the same. Ha ha ha ha ha!

Instead of planned or hoped-for trips to Disney World, Munich, New Orleans, and Paris, I had a long weekend in the Catskills amid more than 300 days stuck at home. Instead of office parties and work-subsidized gym training, I bought a new standing desk and a Peloton and spent thousands of hours in my attic. 2020 was defined by a _lot_ of things, but mobility and experiencing different places was not one of them.

Sheltering in place has served its purpose: none of the three of us have been infected with or exposed to COVID. And we've been pretty comfortable â€” my job has been stable and secure, we've watched lots of movies and built over a dozen big LEGO sets.

This year, instead of rambling about where I _went_, let's instead focus on what I _did_, which may be more interesting anyway.

## Working from Home

My last visit to my office in New York City was on Tuesday, March 4, 2020, and it turns out I will not be returning to that office even post-COVID. A few weeks ago our facilities department finally packed up all our things and put them into storage; as far as I know we're not renewing the lease on that space, so whenever we're finally allowed back it will be to a different building.

Unlike many of my NYC- and SF-based co-workers, I worked remotely full-time for over a decade and have always had a home office set up, and most of my day is video calls with California anyway. I think I transitioned to working from home much more smoothly than a lot of folks.

Last January, before the lockdowns, I was asked to take on not one but _two_ new roles at work, leading product management for both [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Google Design](https://design.google). The Google Design role was eliminated in a reorg in late spring, allowing me to focus on the Fonts team until later in the year, when I was asked to take on some work leading Material Design adoption inside Google, while continuing as Fonts PM.

In March, we [launched a major update to the Google Fonts website](https://design.google/news/happy-anniversary-google-fonts/), featuring new ways to find and use [variable fonts](https://design.google/library/variable-fonts-are-here-to-stay/). A lot of my time this year went toward some big updates to Google's brand typeface, Google Sans, including a new text optical size which you can see on [the design.google blog](https://design.google).

One of many posts I've been meaning to write is about my WFH setup and tips, though to be honest a lot of my tips boil down to "have extra space at home" and "spend money on stuff." I will say that if you (or your employer) can buy only one expensive thing for working from home, make it an ergonomic chair. The Herman Miller Aeron I bought in my original first year of WFH in 2006 is still around, and has saved my ass (muscles, also my back) in these unusual times.

## Working Out

Last year I wrote:

> Late in the year, I discovered that one of our many office perks is on-site, subsidized personal training â€”&nbsp;I started a new fitness program right before Thanksgiving â€¦ In 2020, I'm hoping to keep up two habits: blogging, and working out. Both are things I used to do a lot, but fell out of practice.

It's funny that I put these two things together â€” while I (allegedly) like writing and just don't give myself time and space to do it very often, exercise for me has always been a chore. What they have in common is that I wanted to make new habits of both, but I was a lot more successful at blogging than working out.

At-home fitness _boomed_ in 2020. Peloton sales predictably soared as lockdowns started; I rushed to order one shortly after work-from-home started, after a Bay Area co-worker mentioned a multi-week waitlist when trying to get one. A lot of people (including my wife) moved their in-person fitness classes or training sessions to Zoom, and my trainer offered to keep working with me over video, but pre-recorded cycling classes are working fine for me.

Well, "fine." After an initial few weeks' streak of frequent workouts, later in the year I fell off the horse and have been riding once or twice a week. (But, of course, no time like the present to try to pick that back up!)

Getting the Peloton into my attic â€” which serves as my combination fitness studio, work-from-home space, LEGO playroom, and storage junk pile â€”Â was one of the first really farcical moments of COVID: Peloton would only deliver it to my doorstep, requiring me to get an 80-pound metal bike through my door and up two narrow staircases by myself. (This was still easier than moving my new standing desk, which arrived in May.)

## Writing

Truly, if I've learned anything from the pandemic it's that my relationship with writing and blogging (not to mention personal web site design) isâ€¦ fraught. I spent a lot of this year redoing and re-redoing this site but _not_ crafting new content. This site's audience is practically nonexistent, so I really have no one to please but myself, but I'm a perfectionist, which means I'm exceedingly hard to please.

In January, I started writing regular posts for a week or two, mostly in the "product management thought-leader" genre, e.g. [On "authority"](/p/on-authority) and [People over work product](/p/people-over-work-product). These posts are OK, but re-reading them now I think I was, amazingly, both half-assing it (both were written in short bursts while waiting for meetings to start) and trying too hard.

In May, looking for a COVID-era outlet, I jumped on the Substack bandwagon and revived a newsletter I'd written for a bit while my daughter was a newborn, intending for it to be a weekly thing. It happened to start days before George Floyd's killing, so the second issue didn't come out until later in the summer, after which I had a decent run of sticking to my planned weekly schedule, until the fall/winter holidays and pandemic fatigue finally knocked me off my rhythm.

All told I wrote 13 issues in 2020; my favorites were:
* [the first one](https://demaree.substack.com/p/1-finishing-things-in-an-uncertain)
* [the one about *Breath of the Wild*'s Korok seeds](https://demaree.substack.com/p/3-883-korok-seeds-and-counting)
* [the one about the *Transformers* episode about a spore-borne hate plague](https://demaree.substack.com/p/5-a-spore-borne-hate-plague)
* [the one about uncanny normalcy](https://demaree.substack.com/p/9-uncanny-normalcy)
* [the one about "hyperfreedom"](https://demaree.substack.com/p/12-the-reality-issue)

I haven't decided yet if the next one will be issue #14, or the first issue of a new series, or if I'll just focus on my website instead of [a kinda creepy VC-backed content monetization platform](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/04/is-substack-the-media-future-we-want). We'll see how the year goes! ðŸ˜…

One lightbulb moment I had this week: I miss writing technical posts. I did publish one good one this year â€” [a tutorial on how to change your Git repo's main branch name](/p/no-more-git-masters) â€” and in the course of making four new iterations of this personal site I learned a ton and have some tricks to share. So watch out for more JavaScript, CSS, and static site generator content in this space.

## Following Long, Elaborate Instruction Manuals

During COVID lockdowns, I relished the chance to spend time deepening and strengthening one of my oldest, closest relationships â€”Â with LEGOs. With help from my six-year-old, I built seven LEGO sets, mostly giant ones aimed at teens and adults. (June has gotten really good at building expert-level sets.)

* [Bookshop](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/bookshop-10270) (2020's Creator Expert Modular Building)
* [Assembly Square](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/assembly-square-10255) (2017's super-sized Modular Building)
* [The Mandalorian's ship, the *Razor Crest*](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/default-the-mandalorian-bounty-hunter-transport-au-the-razor-crest-nz-the-razor-crest-75292)
* [Mickey Mouse's *Steamboat Willie*](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/steamboat-willie-21317)
* [The Disney Cinderella Castle](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/the-disney-castle-71040)
* [*Harry Potter*'s Diagon Alley](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/diagon-alley-75978), a set of four small Modular Buildings with amazing wizard-y interiors
* [Corner Garage](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/corner-garage-10264) (2019's Modular Building)

All these new buildings join the [Downtown Diner](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/downtown-diner-10260), which I built more than two years ago. The modular buildings can connect together to make adorable tiny retail strips (and the *Harry Potter* buildings are compatible with the city ones); a row of these buildings is now set up as my WFH video backdrop in my office.

Some people really enjoy inventing new LEGO structures; I really like collecting these big, limited-edition, many thousand-piece sets, and the soothing pleasure of building them over the course of several days during long weekends. LEGO nerdery has been an okay substitute for Disney vacation planning nerdy that had been my number one hobby in the Before Times. Whether or not travel comes back this year, you can be sure I'll be building a lot more.

:: DELETED :

I'm writing this on January 7, 2021, a week into a new year that, for all our bitching about 2020 and hopes for 2021, is already _worse_ than most of 2020 â€” right-wing goons just stormed the U.S. Capitol, for the second January in a row the U.S. House is working to impeach and remove Donald Trump, and over 4,000 Americans (and tens of thousands worldwide) died yesterday from COVIDâ€“19, a number that is expected to get worse as it doesn't yet include the effects of holiday gatherings.

The next two weeks threaten to bring even more political chaos and violence in the U.S., and we can look forward to _months_ more death from COVID until vaccine supply and distribution begin to nudge us toward normalcy. And that doesn't begin to get into what climate change or the recessed global economy may have in store for us. 2021 may yet be, for the fifth year in a row, The Worst Year Ever.
