<strong><em>What the Disney Dining Plan teaches us about user research and consumer behavior</em></strong>

When you book a Disney World vacation package directly from Disney, one of the most popular (and expensive) up-sells is something called the Disney Dining Plan (DDP), where Disney will sell you a whole vacation's worth of meals at a fixed price, based on the number and ages of people in your party, the number of nights you're staying at a Disney-owned resort hotel, and how many of which kinds of meals you want to eat (e.g. counter service or table service).

DDP is a popular option because it sure <em>seems</em> like a good value. Disney World is notoriously yet variably expensive, with food options ranging from a $10 hot dog &amp; fries combo to $60+ prix fixe meals, so the option to lock in a sensible-seeming daily rate for everyone's food and snacks can be appealing. You get to focus on your vacation instead of on how much you're spending on food, and it seems like you'll save money.

What makes DDP controversial, at least among Disney vacation-planning nerds (like me), is that it's actually pretty easy to not only not save money on the plan, but end up losing money, or rather, end up overpaying Disney relative to what you would have spent if you'd paid cash for the food you actually wanted to eat. You can also find yourself feeling pressure to order extra courses or drinks because they're included in your DDP ‚Äî you've already paid for them, after all.

I find DDP, like many Disney World details, bizarrely fascinating as an expression of economics, user behavior, and how just plain irrationally people (especially myself) can behave when engaging with The Happiest Place on Earth. Here, as I re-analyze my family's upcoming Disney vacation, are some of my random thoughts at the intersection of product, business, and Mickey Bars.

<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>

<h2>DDP, Data, and Decision Making</h2>

The perceived value of DDP, and the fact that Disney seems to sell a buttload of dining plans despite their not always being a good deal, struck me today as a good illustration of <strong>the difference between observed behavior and stated intention</strong>. Or, put more simply, <strong>the difference between what users <em>say</em> they want or will do, and how they actually <em>behave</em></strong>.

A DDP add-on purchase is a one-page upsell, in the middle of the checkout flow for what for most people is a many-thousand-dollar vacation purchase.

The question asked by that page could be stated as:<em> </em>

<em>Based on zero knowledge of how you will feel or what your other priorities will be during this trip, do you think you will spend more or less than this amount on food during this vacation?</em>

Here you're placing a bet that Future You's dining habits will cost at or above a certain amount of money quoted as part of selling you something. If you feel confident that you'll spend more than that, then you might take the deal in order to lock in some savings.

On the other hand, if you decide what to eat and drink as you feel hungry or thirsty, that‚Äôs based on real data, not a prediction that may or may not be accurate. ‚ÄúI feel like a tall latte‚Äù is an empirical observation of one‚Äôs own needs; ‚ÄúI expect to drink 2 grande iced coffees per day next April‚Äù is a prediction.

It may be a reasonable prediction. In addition to "I feel like a tall latte right now", which is <em>current data</em>, you might also be able to base a decision on <em>historical data</em>, e.g. "last year at Disney I got 2 grande iced coffees at the park each day," or "during the summer I often buy iced coffee." In some Agile planning methodologies, this is called <a href="http://www.agilenutshell.com/yesterdays_weather">"yesterday's weather"</a>. You can't know for sure what will happen in the future, but odds are that you'll be wrong less often if you base future projections on past behavior.

In either case, you have real behavioral data to work with, which is a fair bit better than basing a multi-thousand-dollar buying decision on what you <em>think</em> or <em>feel like</em> you will want in the future.

Applied to product thinking and user research, the lesson here is that <strong>when it comes to making solid bets, behavioral data rules.</strong> As Erika Hall has written in <a href="https://medium.com/mule-design/on-surveys-5a73dda5e9a0">her essay about the dangers of surveys</a>:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">Never ask people to make a prediction of their own future behavior. They will make that prediction based on wishful thinking or social desirability. And this, I think, is the most popular survey question of all:<em>How likely are you to purchase the thing I am selling in the next 6 months?</em></blockquote>

When deciding on whether or not to prepay for meals you won't eat for a year, it's easy to inflate Future You's appetite or energy level. We all have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias">optimism bias</a>, and dining out is fun, so it's tempting to let Disney roll up a whole vacation's worth of fun dining-out experiences and assign a price to that.

Here I'm talking about prepaying for Mickey Premium Bars, but I think the same concepts apply to all kinds of speculative decision-making, and how to evaluate whatever data you're using to make a big decision. Your emotions and perception will lie to you if you let them, but observed behavior is at least a little closer to truth, and easier to analyze than, say, loading all Disney restaurants' prices into a spreadsheet and crunching numbers for fun.

Not that I know anyone who has done that.

<h2>DDP &amp; Total Emotional Cost of Ownership</h2>

The last section probably seemed like a strong, rational argument against prepaying for a Disney Dining Plan. There is a strong argument against DDP; if you're a modest eater, or prefer to spend time waiting for rides than enjoying a Costco bulk pack of three-course meals, you will probably lose money on DDP.

And yet it remains popular enough that <a href="https://www.yourwdwstore.net/Disney-Adult-Shirt--Im-On-The-Dining-Plan-_p_71858.html">it has its own t-shirt</a>. What's up with that?

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.yourwdwstore.net/thumbnail.asp?file=assets/images/7/70000/1000/800/71858-s1.jpg&amp;maxx=300&amp;maxy=0" alt=""/></figure></div>

I think it's the same reason why, even though one can get phones and laptops than iPhones or Macs that are a better value based on specs, people remain loyal to Apple because of reduced<em> hassle</em>, which one could call "total <em>emotional</em> cost of ownership."

Charles Revson, founder of Revlon, famously said that while "in the factory I make lipstick, <a href="https://empwaynek.wordpress.com/2017/02/13/we-sell-hope/">in the drugstore I sell hope</a>." This was an early evocation of <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done">Clayton Christensen's "jobs to be done" framework</a>‚Äîpeople choose products based on the role they fill in their lives, which may not be their intended or expected purpose. 

Some people buy jumbo-sized packages of things at Costco because they've done the math and find the per-unit cost to be lower. But others do it because they like the emotional safety of knowing they have a month's supply of canned green beans or La Croix in their pantry, saving or simplifying a future trip to the grocery store. In addition to any monetary savings, you're buying Future You the present of a slightly easier life.

If you make dining decisions at the last actionable moment ‚Äî in the moment, at the park ‚Äî you have the best data, and you get to make better decisions. You also have to potentially make <em>more</em> decisions. Some people prefer that kind of control; if that sounds like you, you probably should not buy a Dining Plan if you go to Disney World.

<h3>DDP Pricing vs Common-Sense Eating Habits</h3>

Disney generally does not resort to dark patterns or deceptive marketing to sell vacations or theme park tickets ‚Äî they really, <em>really</em> don‚Äôt have to ‚Äî but a cynical take on DDP may be that it's as close as they come.

In finance, a good reason to pay for something in advance is as a hedge against future price fluctuations ‚Äî&nbsp;for example, airlines buy petroleum futures to lock in a stable price for fuel, so they can in turn know how much to charge passengers. McDonalds buys beef futures, tech companies buy energy futures, and so on, so that the costs of goods and materials they depend on are less subject to the whims of the marketplace.

In almost all cases, Disney controls both sides of dining transactions at Disney World. (There are a small number of independently owned restaurants, mostly at the Disney Springs mall area; many of them accept DDP.) The variables aren't how much food will cost, but how much you (the consumer) want to spend and how much you want to eat/drink.

The price of DDP seems to be set at the far edge of (or even a bit beyond) what a typical family would spend on meals, based on Disney's menu prices and some common-sense analysis of people's likely habits. The low-end DDP costs $55/day for adults for 2 counter-service meals (plus beverages, which can include alcohol) and 2 snacks. Snacks range from $2-8(!), while counter-service entrees are roughly $10-19, and beverages are about $3-12. That means the value of what you get for that $55 could be as high as $78, but also as low as $30.

So Disney, wisely, doesn't actively market Dining Plans as a cost savings measure. The <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/plans/">Dining Plans page of the Disney World web site</a> emphasizes different value propositions for each tier:

<ul><li>The Quick Service plan is described as "fast and easy"</li><li>The standard/classic Dining Plan talks about being "waited on" at table service restaurants, implying that it's for people who want a reason to splurge on sit-down meals they might otherwise skip</li><li>And the Deluxe Dining Plan, my precioussss, is described as "an epicurean journey", to "make your dining experience one to remember."</li></ul>

All of these describe <em>experiences</em>, and seem to be paired with different user personae. One imagines the Quick Service DDP customers are bigger families who want a simpler vacation, standard DDP customers are folks who want a balance of simplicity and mild luxury, and Deluxe folks are foodie travelers like me (sigh), whose one regret is not finding time this trip for dinner at <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/epcot/le-cellier-steakhouse/">Le Cellier</a>.

The way Disney markets/sells DDP is potentially a "gray pattern" ‚Äî not a scam, but not as straightforward as one might prefer ‚Äî because, like buying a shiny used car or fix-me-upper house with big front yard energy, it makes less sense the more you examine the details, and (as with many things Disney World-related) landing the sale can rely on a mix of appealing to emotion, then dazzling the mind with reasonable-seeming data. DDP can be like buying a 4-pack of gallon jars of mayo, where the job-to-be-done is never having to buy mayo again, even if most of your brain (or your wise partner) is saying it's stupid to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B7Bol8cDg0V/">buy so much mayo</a>, but some small part of you imagines all the chicken salad you could make.

<h2>DDP Tips, or: I Swear This Is Not #sponcon</h2>

You've come a long way, if you've read this far, so it's time for me to admit it: I am not only a DDP purchaser, but a repeat buyer of the highest-end Deluxe Dining Plan. I guess this makes me a DDP proponent?

Here are my Disney Dining Plan‚Äîwell, I hesitate to call them "tips", so let's say "principles":

In my opinion the Deluxe dining plan is the only one that's worth the money. I've crunched the numbers and for the lower-tier ones to break even you have to make dining choices that are, frankly, unreasonable, like using your snack credits for giant novelty shakes or $8 orders of cheese fries. The Deluxe plan (which gives you 3 meals per day) is about 50% more expensive than the standard one (which gives you 2), but each meal is more valuable because all three can be table service, and all three can come with dessert. Well played, Disney.

In 2020, the Deluxe plan costs about $120/day for adults. If you make sure to maximize the value of snack credits (never get anything that retails for less than $6), the value of each meal credit is about $36. If you spend more than that on average over the course of your trip, you've at least broken even, and may have come out ahead.

Our family is a big fan of character meals, which tend to be prix fixe buffet or family-style meals priced at $45-50 per adult. As $45 is a bit over $36, these meals are where DDP really shows its value, especially if you do this multiple times per day. In addition to being a good value, character meals are also a good use of time ‚Äî instead of standing in line to meet characters, you get to sit and eat Mickey Waffles while Rapunzel or Stitch come to meet <em>you.</em>

A few Disney meals ‚Äî at "signature" restaurants like Le Cellier, dinner shows, or the highest-demand character meals in Magic Kingdom ‚Äî cost <em>two</em> credits, which of course means their value benchmark is $72, not $36. In general this is an easier target to hit at dinner than at breakfast or lunch, and if you order alcohol, it's a slam dunk. (Prix fixe dinner at Be Our Guest, the restaurant inside the Beast's castle, is $63, and they have a lovely Cabernet by the glass for $20.)

However, where the 2-credit restaurants <em>really</em> work out is with kids' pricing. Deluxe DDP is just $45/day for children under 9, but a prix fixe dinner or breakfast can be as much as $37. (Yes, $37 for eggs and waffles for a 5 year old. Disney can be cruel.) That $45 includes the same 2 snacks as the adult plans, so even if you used 2 credits for a big-ticket meal, you're most likely saving money and get at least one meal "for free". Repeat that a few times over the course of a trip and the savings can offset any less-than-optimal DDP usage from adults in your party.

In short, as I've said, DDP is like buying a bulk pack of luxurious resort meals at Costco. It is probably a more rational decision not to buy it, but in my view the next most rational decision is to buy it and then use the heck out of it. Make dining a key part of your vacation ‚Äî that's arguably what it's there for. And even if Disney's not profiting off of you (as much) they're keeping you out of the line for Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, which is just as important.
