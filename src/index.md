Hi, I'm David. I love code, cameras, coffee, and cocktails. (Also alliteration.) I live in the NYC suburbs with [my wife](https://instagram.com/jdweinmann), our 5-year-old kid, and [a French bulldog](https://instagram.com/johnny.cash.frenchie). {.home-title .font-display-serif .text-4xl .leading-tight .max-w-content .mx-auto .mb-4}

I've been making web sites and web software for 25 years, starting with little toy projects in high school and college, but more recently leading product design &amp; development at big-ass companies. {.text-2xl .font-serif .max-w-content .mx-auto}
