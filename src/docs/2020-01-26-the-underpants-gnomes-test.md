In 1998, Comedy Central first aired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomes_(South_Park)">the <em>South Park</em> episode called "Gnomes"</a>, introducing the most elegant takedown of bubbly, non-sensical business models in the history of the world:

What makes this such a great and enduring (and hilarious) image is that what's missing (as represented by the question mark) is anything to do with customers — which is <em>the whole point of business</em>. There is no Clay Christensen <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done">job-to-be-done</a> here; the gnomes are motivated by the dream of profit, but what they're actually pursuing day to day are underpants for the sake of underpants.

I often use the underpants gnomes as a working mental model for product management, as a sort of unit test for whether a given activity is likely or not to lead to a good customer outcome:

<strong>For any given activity — a project, program, job story, whatever — can we fill in all three phases of the underpants gnomes' chart, even just hypothetically?</strong>

The "hypothetically" part is important — it's OK to be wrong, so long as you're thinking about how all the pieces of a strategy line up, and calling out your assumptions.

<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>We will…</th><th>In order to…</th><th>So that…</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Collect underpants</td><td>Sell underpants inventory via online underpants marketplace</td><td>Profit!</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

This doesn't say anything about whether there are any <em>buyers</em> on this underpants marketplace (though since the gnomes are stealing the underpants, one has to imagine that every sale would be pure profit), but at least we have a stated idea about how the activity can lead to the outcome. This is a better model if the marketplace exists. (If it doesn't, then this is just shifting the question mark—<em>Create online underpants marketplace, ???, Profit!</em>)

In a slightly more real-world scenario:

<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>We will…</th><th>In order to…</th><th>So that…</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Build Slack integration for our underpants marketplace</td><td>???</td><td>Profit!</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

In that feature description, "Slack" could be any hot platform or product category. Maybe the mechanic here is that people would use slash commands to manage underpants listings or find underpants to buy. In either case, it sounds like a cool thing to build, and allows you to use a strong brand like Slack's in your marketing, which ought to attract… someone. Right?

I also think of this as the <a href="https://coachingforleaders.com/podcast/if-you-build-it-they-will-come/">"if we build it, they will come"</a> fallacy — when you conclude that the thing you're doing will lead to success, not based on any evaluation of what the market wants, but because you (or the team, or the boss) want to do it, and are not only unwilling or unable to admit that you're making a speculative bet but rally your team around the riches and fame that are sure to follow once you've gathered enough underpants.

Let's assume delivering the chosen feature is a given, and maybe that's fine. A lot of teams are set up <a href="https://cutle.fish/blog/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory">primarily to crank out features</a>, with incentive structures like bonuses and job ladders organized to reward getting more or bigger things out the door. But a common dysfunction I've seen is when teams' day to day process is optimized around delivering whatever they're tasked to work on — "gathering underpants", in other words — but their incentive/reward criteria are based on impact, which may never come because the connection between the work and its impact was never stated or tested.

To sum up: for any project or feature bet you're considering, apply the underpants gnomes test — try to fill in all three parts of the chart, connecting your activity or deliverable to the customer, and from there to the desired outcome for your product.

At best, this might help you avoid investing precious time and energy into an underpants-gathering task. But even at a minimum, this can be a good exercise to set better expectations about how speculative a given bet is, which may be a stepping stone toward using each project as a smaller and faster path to feedback.
